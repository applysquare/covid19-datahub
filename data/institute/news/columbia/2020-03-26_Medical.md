Medical students in their final year at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons will graduate a month early and be offered temporary employment at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. Students will graduate on April 15; the original graduation date was May 20.
