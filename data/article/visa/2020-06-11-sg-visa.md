In view of the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world, Singapore will implement additional precautionary measures to further reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 to Singapore. These include further restrictions on travellers coming into Singapore. Click [here](/docs/default-source/ica/publications/faqs-on-new-border-control-measures.pdf?sfvrsn=ebde3eb3_24 "FAQ on COVID-19") for Frequently Asked Questions. For more details, visit the [MOH website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 "MOH: Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation") or see section "Latest Updates" below for press releases/advisories. #### Mandatory for travellers entering Singapore to serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at SHN Dedicated Facilities To protect the local community and ring-fence the risk of community transmission from imported cases, it is mandatory for all travellers entering Singapore (inclusive of Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders or foreign visitors allowed entry) to be served with SHN. They are to serve their SHN at a dedicated facility assigned to them. Click [here](/covid-19/shn) for more information about SHN issued by ICA. For those with extenuating circumstances, such as medical conditions or mobility issues that make it difficult for them to stay in SHN Dedicated Facilities, they should provide the details in this form at [go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds](https://www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds "Assistance for Returnees from Designated Countries"). They can also contact the SHN Helpline at 6812 5555 for further assistance. Travellers entering Singapore with valid SafeTravel Passes will be exempted from SHN. They will conversely be subjected to a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test post-arrival in Singapore. For more information on the SafeTravel Pass, see section on "For travellers seeking entry into Singapore under Green/Fast Lane arrangements" below. #### All travellers seeking entry into Singapore must submit health declarations All travellers must submit a health declaration via the SG Arrival Card (SGAC) [e-Service](/eservicesandforms/e-arrival-card) before proceeding with immigration clearance[1] in Singapore. They are required to show their health declaration acknowledgement email[2] to an ICA officer for arrival immigration clearance. See section on "Health Declaration via Sg Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service" below for more information. Singapore's measures for inbound travellers in relation to COVID-19 are summarised in this [Appendix](/docs/default-source/ica/publications/appendix-covid-19.pdf "Appendix: Singapore"). If you are overseas, you may visit this [website](https://www.singaporeglobalnetwork.com/resources/covid-19/ "Singapore Global Network") for updates on Singapore’s COVID-19 situation, or the MOH’s website for [update on COVID-19 local situation](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/ "Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation"). _[1] Travellers can submit their health declaration via the SG Arrival Card [e-Service](/eservicesandforms/e-arrival-card) within 3 days prior to the date of their arrival in Singapore. Travellers are also reminded to update and resubmit their declarations prior to arrival in Singapore if they have recently visited a hospital, had contact with a COVID-19 case, and/or if there is any change in their health status and/or travel history. Please refer to this [press release](/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service "All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service") for more information._ _[2] Returning Singapore residents and long-term pass holders, who had travelled to China for essential business or official travel under the Green/Fast Lane arrangements, must also present to the ICA officers a Letter of Invitation issued by the relevant local Chinese authorities._ 

For Singapore residents entering Singapore 

All Singapore residents (i.e. Singapore citizens, permanent residents) will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon entry into Singapore. They are to serve their SHN at a dedicated facility assigned to them. Click [here](https://www-ica-gov-sg-admin.cwp-stg.sg/covid-19/shn) for more information about SHN issued by ICA. See also section on "Notice to all travellers entering Singapore". All Singapore residents entering Singapore with valid SafeTravel Passes will be exempted from SHN. They will conversely be subjected to a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test post-arrival in Singapore. For more information on SafeTravel Pass, see section on "For travellers seeking entry into Singapore under Green/Fast Lane arrangements" below. Singapore's measures for inbound travellers in relation to COVID-19 are summarised in this [Appendix](/docs/default-source/ica/publications/appendix-covid-19.pdf "Appendix: Singapore"). 

For long-term pass holders seeking entry into Singapore 

All foreigners holding ICA-issued long-term passes (i.e. Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Student's Pass (STP), or In-Principle Approval (IPA) letters for LTVP/STP) who plan to enter Singapore from any country must obtain permission for entry from the relevant agency before they commence their journey. LTVP/STP and IPA for LTVP/STP holders who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Those who are entering Singapore on SafeTravel Pass will be exempted from SHN and will conversely be subjected to a Polymerase Chain Reaction test post-arrival in Singapore.

Singapore's measures for inbound travellers in relation to COVID-19 are summarised in this [Appendix](/docs/default-source/ica/publications/appendix-covid-19.pdf "Appendix: Singapore"). #### Entry Approval For Holders of LTVPs, STPs and IPAs for LTVP/STP (issued by ICA) All LTVP holders[3], as well as those who have been granted IPA for LTVP, who are planning to enter Singapore, must obtain ICA's permission to enter before they commence their journey to Singapore. They can do so by submitting their application for entry to [ICA nCoV Request](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3648e9405c180011dc5f9c). STP holders, and those who have been granted IPA for STP, who plan to enter Singapore from any country must obtain Ministry of Education (MOE)'s permission before they commence their journey. At this juncture, STP holders who are students in critical sectors in publicly-funded Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will be prioritised for entry approval. STP holders, and those who have been granted IPA for STP, should submit their applications to their respective institutions, which will then forward their application to MOE. If permission is granted, applicants will be issued an approval letter of entry. They must produce this approval letter of entry to airline staff upon check-in at the departure airport, and to the ICA officer at the checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore. Please refer to this [press release](/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders "Entry Approval Required For All Long-Term Pass Holders") for more information. _[3] LTVPs are also issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to common-law spouses, step-children, handicapped children or parents of an Employment Pass or S Pass holder. MOM-issued LTVP holders will have to obtain MOM's approval for entry._ #### Entry Approval for MOM's Work Pass Holders The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) requires all new and existing Work Pass holders[4] (including dependants[5]) to obtain MOM's approval before they commence their journey to Singapore. The entry approval requirement applies to: * Existing Work Pass holders currently out of Singapore; and * Those who have been granted IPA for a Work Pass, and yet to enter Singapore Their employers or sponsors must submit the request. Please refer to the relevant links. * [Work Permit, S Pass or Employment Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19) * [EntrePass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/entrepass/covid-19-precautionary-measures) * Personalised Employment Pass - [with employer](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19) or [without employer](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/personalised-employment-pass/covid-19-precautionary-measures) * [Dependant's Pass, MOM-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or Letter of Consent (LOC)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19) * [Training Work Permit or Training Employment Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19) * [Work Holiday Pass (WHP) - WHP Programme](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-holiday-programme/covid-19-precautionary-measures) * [WHP - Work and Holiday Visa Programme](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-and-holiday-visa-programme/covid-19-precautionary-measures) Those with ICA-issued LTVPs will need ICA's approval of entry, even if they have LOCs issued by MOM. Anyone who does not comply with the requirements will have their passes revoked and will be banned from working in Singapore. Please refer to this [press release](/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/entry-approval-required-for-all-long-term-pass-holders "Entry Approval Required For All Long-Term Pass Holders") for more information. _[4] Holders of LTVP issued by ICA, who also have a Letter of Consent (LOC) or Pre-Approved Letter of Consent (PLOC) issued by MOM, should obtain ICA's approval of entry._ _[5] Dependant's Pass holders and MOM-issued LTVP holders._

All short-term visitors will not be allowed to enter Singapore, except the following, subject to conditions: * Visitors[6] issued with SafeTravel Pass. For more information, visit the [SafeTravel Pass Application Portal](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/). * Visitors with approval letter of entry from the relevant agency in Singapore.

Short-term visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Those entering Singapore with valid SafeTravel Passes will be exempted from SHN. They will conversely be subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction test post-arrival in Singapore. For more information on SafeTravel Pass, see section on "For travellers seeking entry into Singapore under Green/Fast Lane arrangements" below. Click [here](/covid-19/shn "SHN issued by ICA") for more information about SHN issued by ICA. Visitors who are already in Singapore will not be affected by the recent policy. You may apply [online](/esvclandingpage/extend) if there is a need to extend your stay in Singapore. Extension of stay will not be accepted over the counter. Singapore’s measures for inbound travellers in relation to COVID-19 are summarised in this [Appendix](/docs/default-source/ica/publications/appendix-covid-19.pdf "Appendix: Singapore"). _[6] These residents will still need a visa as per [entry requirements](/enteringanddeparting/entry_requirements), if they hold a visa-required travel document. There is no need to apply for a new visa if they have an existing valid visa as the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel pass is approved._ 

For travellers seeking entry into Singapore under Green/Fast Lane arrangements 

#### Application for SafeTravel Pass under Green/Fast Lane arrangements Travellers from countries/regions under the Green/Fast Lane arrangements must possess a valid SafeTravel Pass in order to travel to Singapore[7]. The sponsoring company or government agency in Singapore is to submit an application for the traveller's SafeTravel Pass via the [SafeTravel Pass Application Portal](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/). From 8 June 2020, only business or official travellers sponsored by a Singapore Government agency may submit applications. Applications for company-sponsored travellers will be accepted at a later phase. All travellers are required to comply with the [Terms & Conditions](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/terms-and-conditions/) of the SafeTravel Pass. Please note that any Visit Pass issued to travellers holding SafeTravel Passes is subject to these Terms & Conditions. Non-compliance with any of the Terms & Conditions may result in the traveller being refused entry or his Visit Pass being cancelled. Please note that the SafeTravel Pass is **not** a Visit Pass. It provides travellers with permission to travel to Singapore, but travellers must still present themselves to an ICA officer for arrival immigration clearance. Other than meeting the Terms & Conditions of the SafeTravel Pass, travellers must also meet other [entry requirements](/enteringanddeparting/entry_requirements) before they can be granted a Visit Pass for entry/stay in Singapore. For any enquiries relating to the SafeTravel Pass, please refer to the [FAQs](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/faq/main) or contact [COVID_SAFETRAVELPASS@mti.gov.sg](mailto:COVID_SAFETRAVELPASS@mti.gov.sg). _[7] As of 8 June 2020, Singapore has Green/Fast Lane arrangements with the following six provinces/municipalities in China - Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang._
