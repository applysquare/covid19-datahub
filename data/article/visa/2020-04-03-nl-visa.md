# Coronavirus: visas for the Netherlands

<div class="intro">

The global development regarding the COVID-19 virus has far-reaching consequences for the services provided by Dutch embassies worldwide, including external service providers such as visa agencies.

This means that until at least 28 April 2020 no passport applications, visa applications for short and long stays (authorization for temporary stay, mvv) will be collected via embassies and visa agencies.

Other services, such as DNA tests, identity screening, legalization of documents and 'basic civic integration examination abroad' will not take place during this period.

In the Q&A's you can find the answers to the most frequently asked questions. Keep an eye on this website for more information.
