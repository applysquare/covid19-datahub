| UQ Semester 2, 2020 Exchange Cancellation | Semester 2, 2020 students | Student Employability Director  
  
As you may be aware, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) issued a world wide travel ban for all Australian Citizens, effective midday 25 March 2020.

 

In light of these announcements and the rapidly evolving circumstances arising from the present COVID-19 outbreak, The University of Queensland has decided that it cannot support Semester 2, 2020 exchange. We appreciate that this is a very difficult time for you, and it is not the outcome that you have been hoping for, however this decision was made after careful consideration of a range of factors listed below:

  * Restrictions to all university travel until further notice (see [FAQ's for UQ Travellers](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wqiDv8S~_73Gmtm~yIp2uMoyC77Mv~E~z7~Pv8N&2=24484))
  * Airlines globally significantly reducing capacity and cancelling services
  * Global travel bans which are in place for the foreseeable future



We understand you may have some questions following this decision, and we have provided some additional information below that may help.

 

**Can I defer my exchange to Semester 1, 2021?**

 

**With Host:** we are checking with our partner institutions to confirm whether the number of places available for Sem 2, 2020 can be extended to Semester 1, 2021.

 

**With UQ:** it is not possible for existing applications to be deferred due to the allocation process, which considers cohort applications, preferences, and available places. Students wishing to go on exchange in Semester 1, 2021 will need to apply by 26 June 2020, have their eligibility re-assessed, and submit a new study plan.

 

Your application for exchange in Semester 2, 2020, will shortly be administratively withdrawn in the system, but we hope to be able to work with you to help you identify and apply for another global experience in the future.

If you have any further questions, or require any additional support, please contact the Global Experiences Team via [uqabroad@uq.edu.au](mailto:uqabroad@uq.edu.au).

Kind regards,
