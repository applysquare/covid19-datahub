Our UQ Life Facebook page ([follow here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24686)) and our [FAQ](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24687) page will continue to be updated as required with new information.

Your studies

  * You said, we listened: Click [here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24705) to see how UQ is responding to your questions and concerns around studies, exams, fees, and how to adjust to online studies.
  * GPA: UQ courses will be graded and GPAs calculated as usual. However, where assessment is heavily impacted by the current situation (such as health placement courses), grading in some courses may change to become Pass/Fail. You can read more about this decision and what this means for you [here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24689).
  * Withdrawal Without Academic Penalty (WWAP): This has been extended until 2 days after the end of the official examinations period (13th July 2020). If you sit your exams and then make an informed decision about withdrawing there will be no academic penalty prior to grade release, and you will receive a grade of ‘W’ (= withdrawn) which will not affect your GPA.
  * Assessment extensions / exam deferrals: You may not need a medical certificate; you can provide a statement outlining your circumstances. See details on the student FAQ tab [here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24690).
  * Free student software for personal use: If you use specialist software on-campus at our UQ computer labs, you can now access many of these applications remotely for free. For a full list of specialist software available click [here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24691).
  * Laptop loan scheme: The UQ Library’s [Laptops for Loan](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24692) scheme is up and running and there are still laptops available for those students requiring this support.



Health and wellbeing

  * Care packages and hardship hampers: [Student Services](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24693) is delivering care packages at no cost to students who are currently in hardship or isolation. The team is also delivering hardship hampers for a nominal fee to students who are finding it difficult to get food - for example, where supermarkets are no longer doing deliveries.
  * Financial Hardship Fund: UQ has increased the [UQ Hardship Fund](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24706). This fund is used to support students who find themselves in financial difficulty and may not have the means to continue their studies. Students can apply on-line via the link above.
  * Virtual Village: The [UQ Virtual Village](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&2=24694) is now live. Led by the UQ community, this online village brings your everyday connections into one platform to help you transition your study and social life online.
