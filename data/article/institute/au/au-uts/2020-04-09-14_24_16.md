### MONDAY 23 MARCH 2020

**To check how your enrolled subjects will be delivered from Tuesday 24 March:    **  
1. log into your learning management system ([Blackboard](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/using-uts-systems/blackboard-utsonline) or [Canvas](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/using-uts-systems/canvas)) and check the message board or subject outline for each subject, or    
2. log into your UTS email account and look for an email from your subject coordinators.    

Information about changes to your subject including assessment formats, due dates and the weekly schedule will be communicated to you by your subject coordinator, by email or by publishing the changes online in Canvas or UTSOnline. The changes will be reflected in your subject outlines by Friday 10 April.

While the majority of subjects will be delivered online from **Tuesday 24 March** , in-person learning will still occur for some subjects that utilise the physical space (such as laboratories) but with increased hygiene and social distancing measures. These measures are informed by NSW Health and eliminate ‘close contact’ and therefore decreases risks relating to the spread of the virus.    

A ‘close contact’ is someone who has been face-to-face for at least 15 minutes or has been in the same closed space for at least two hours, as someone who has tested positive for the COVID-19 when that person was infectious.    

Depending on a subject’s requirements, social distancing measures for in-person learning includes:  

  * relocating class to a larger teaching space,  
  * increasing the distance between people in class, and 
  * increased cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces. 



As the situation continues to evolve, it is important to stay up to date with the expert advice from NSW Health. As new information becomes available, we will also be updating our FAQs page and reviewing current social distancing measures. While you may be feeling increased anxiety and uncertainty, please be assured that we are doing all that we can to keep you safe.
