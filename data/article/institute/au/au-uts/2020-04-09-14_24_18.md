While the week-long pause in teaching has allowed us to introduce social distancing to ensure the safety of our students, staff and community, it also means finding room in the academic calendar to make up for that week. 

So you can continue to progress towards your degree, while staying safe:  

  * week 12 will replace final StuVac,  
  * formal classes will end on **Friday 12 June** , and  
  * final assessment period will commence on Saturday 13 June and end on Saturday 27 June.  



We have also given you more time to:  

  * change or add a subject by one week to **Monday 30 March 2020   **
  * withdraw from a subject without academic or financial penalty by on week to **Tuesday 14 April 2020** (Census date)
