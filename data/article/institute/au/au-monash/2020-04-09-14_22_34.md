 **Deferral of admission offers/change of commencement date**

  * If you have a current offer of admission and are unable to commence your enrolment by the date stated in your offer letter, please submit a [request to defer/change](https://gradresearchforms.apps.monash.edu/offer-response) your commencement date form. Please discuss revised dates with your supervisor and/or faculty.

  * Cases for deferral will be assessed on a case-by-case basis - applicants should document the impact of the situation necessitating the deferral request.



 **Newly commencing students not yet enrolled**

  * If graduate research students are unable to commence their PhD or Masters by Research Degree by the commencement date in their offer, we recommend they apply for deferral via the [change of commencement date form](https://gradresearchforms.apps.monash.edu/offer-response).
  *  **Domestic (Australian citizens or permanent resident holders):**
    * Australian citizens or permanent resident holders who are currently in Australia and planned to commence may proceed with their enrolment as planned. However, we recommend you contact your supervisor and faculty to confirm your proposed start date.


  *  **International:**
    * The Australian Government has imposed restrictions on non-citizen entry to Australia from 9pm AEDT 20 March 2020. Refer to the Department of Home Affairs [website](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/news-media/current-alerts/novel-coronavirus) for details.
    * International students who have arrived in Melbourne and completed the required period of self-isolation can contact the University via the Monash Graduate Research Office for advice on how to complete their enrolment.



 **Induction and orientation**

  * Induction for new graduate research students can continue where conducted remotely/digitally.
  * Refer to the [Monash Doctoral Program - Compulsory Module](https://www.intranet.monash/graduate-research/doctoral-program/mydevelopment) to complete all online modules.



 **Enrolment**

  * All currently enrolled graduate research students will continue to be enrolled. Please discuss any potential interruptions to your research with your supervisory team and or graduate research coordinator/director and determine how to minimise any potential impacts on your research project due to travel restrictions, inability to access research equipment or facilities etc. If delays are unavoidable, you can consider a period of leave.
  * Students and supervisory teams should maintain regular contact and develop or review the research project plan to identify the best way to maintain progress, with particular attention to the next six months.



 **Research project progress**

Students should contact their supervisors and put a management plan in place to manage their enrolment over the next six months given the COVID-19 situation. The plan should consider the following matters:

  * Where research data collection activities are unavoidably delayed, you may consider leave options as outlined in the[ Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks](https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources). Refer to Chapter four: Changes to enrolment
  * Students with planned fieldwork should consult their supervisor, review and update their risk assessment to ensure that all current Government requirements can be appropriately accommodated.
  * Research ethics queries in relation to fieldwork protocols should be referred to your supervisor and the Associate Dean (Research) in your Faculty.
  * In the event that your project and fieldwork activities cannot be undertaken or rescoped, you may consider a [leave of absence](https://gradresearchforms.apps.monash.edu/leave).
  * Queries regarding access to on-campus facilities and resources related to your research project should be directed to your supervisor and enrolling Faculty.
  * Where finalisation of your research and/or thesis submission is delayed, you may consider leave options as outlined in the[ Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks](https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources) (Chapter four: Changes to enrolment)or extension provisions (refer to section eight of the [Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures)](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/797157/Graduate-Research-Progress-Management-Procedures.pdf)
  * Where appropriate to do so, students may consider working on their research project from home in consultation with their supervisor, provided that there is a clear and productive work plan and regular contact is maintained, including regular contact with the supervisory team.
  * Where research cannot reasonably progress and other activities such as Monash Doctoral Program professional development are complete, then students may consider a period of leave.
  * Where a currently enrolled student is required to undertake a period of self-isolation, they may undertake their research activities remotely or apply for a period of leave as outlined in the[ Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks](https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources) ****



**Progress management**

  * Students and supervisors should continue to meet, subject to compliance with the **general health information** above.
  * PhD and Research Masters Milestone Review Panels (MRPs) are expected to continue where the mandatory social distance requirements (1.5m between persons and room capacity allowance of no less than 4m2 per person) can be implemented. However, where necessary, the delivery can be modified (for example: presenting and delivering via Zoom). All milestones should be conducted in compliance with the **general health information** above.


  * Milestones that cannot proceed must be rescheduled. Students are reminded to apply for an [extension to a milestone](https://gradresearchforms.apps.monash.edu/milestoneExtension).
