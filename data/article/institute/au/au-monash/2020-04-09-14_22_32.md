  * All graduation ceremonies for May have been postponed until further notice.
  * Instead, we now intend to hold events later this year to celebrate everyone's graduation. These events have not yet been scheduled, and will be subject to health and travel advice. The date and time of your replacement event will be communicated in August.
  * Despite the deferral of upcoming graduation ceremonies, students can still be conferred in May if they're eligible (course completed and not encumbered). Students will receive access to official digital copies of their award certificate (testamur), academic record (transcript) and Australian Higher Education Graduation Statement (AHEGS) in mid-May. The hardcopy award certificate will be made available following, whether or not students plan to attend an event later this year.
  * Alternatively, students can opt to graduate in the September/October ceremony round at Clayton. Taking this option will delay your conferral until this round and you will not get access to your digital documents and hardcopy award certificate until then.



 **Remaining as 'attending' in May round**

  * If you make no change to your graduation application by **Friday 17 April** , you’ll remain as ‘attending’ in the May ceremony round and you will automatically be listed to attend a [replacement event](https://unicrm.my.salesforce.com/articles/Knowledge_Article/FAQ-9051) later this year.
  * This event will be similar to a graduation ceremony, including presentation on stage, as well as gown hire, program and refreshments for you and three guests, but separate from official graduation ceremonies.
  * Your attendance fee is your contribution to the cost of these and won’t be refunded at this time. After receiving replacement event details in August, you may find that you can’t attend – if so, you can request a refund then.
  * If you take this option of attending a replacement event, you cannot attend a later graduation ceremony since your award will already have been conferred.



 **Hardcopy award certificate collection**

  * You can arrange to collect your hardcopy award certificate. Otherwise, we’ll post it to you at no charge.


  * If you wish to collect your certificate from Monash Connect, Clayton campus from Monday 10 August through Friday 14 August, request this via the [Google form](https://forms.gle/WcoVs3jzk3QbmdWH8) by **Sunday 24 May**.
  * If you **don’t** request collection by this deadline, we’ll post your hardcopy award certificate to the address listed in your student record as of Sunday 24 May. So make sure to update your postal address in the Web Enrolment System ([WES](https://my.monash.edu.au/wes/login)) now. And you’ll need someone to sign for the package when it arrives there in June.



 **Change to 'not attending' or opt to attend September/October round**

  *  **Coursework students**
    * If you don’t wish to attend the replacement event later this year, or prefer to attend a ceremony in the September/October round, please contact the [Graduations Unit](https://www.monash.edu/graduations/contact-us).
    * To graduate without attending (in absentia) in the May round:
      * Make this change in [WES](https://my.monash.edu.au/wes/login) by  **Friday** **17 April** to receive a refund of your attendance fee.
      * If you take this option, you cannot attend a later graduation ceremony.
    * To attend a ceremony in the September/October round:
      * Update your application in [WES](https://my.monash.edu.au/wes/login) by  **Friday** **17 April  **to have your attendance fee move with it.
      * If you miss this deadline, you won’t be able to graduate in a later round.
      * If you take this option, you won’t have access to your official digital documents or hardcopy award certificate until your graduation ceremony in September/October.
  *  **Higher Degree by Research students**
