Dear UWA Students

Thank you to everyone who sent through feedback in response to my emails yesterday. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to do so, and we are now working through some of the finer details of your questions and suggestions. This information will be with you shortly.

In short:

FAQs about online exams

Access to UWA buildings from Monday 6 April

Flu vaccinations: additional information

Changes to Transperth services from Monday 6 April

FAQs about online exams

We understand that many of you have questions about how Examplify, our new online exam software, will work.

We have published an FAQ guide that includes information on technical requirements (e.g. operating systems and webcams), and we will be adding to this guide as more information becomes available over the coming days.

Access to UWA buildings from Monday 6 April

Although the majority of students are now studying online, the Crawley campus will remain accessible for students even though buildings will be locked from Monday 6 April 2020, for reasons of security and staff and student safety. This means you will need your campus card to gain access to areas and to be able to identify yourself if you seek assistance from Security.

Reid Library, Beasley Library and J Robin Warren Library will remain open as per previous communications. Where you require other facilities for study, these will be provisioned locally through your School and you should seek clarification as to what local access arrangements are being made.

HDR and research students who need to access facilities can do so but need to agree arrangements with their supervisor.

If you intend to access buildings on the campus, personal safety is paramount. If you are working alone, we strongly advise that you inform Security of your presence by calling 6488 3020 or emailing security@uwa.edu.au.

If for any reason you have concerns about your personal safety on campus, please contact Security who will be happy to assist.

Flu vaccinations: additional information

Yesterday, we let you know that the UWA Medical Centre is now offering flu vaccinations.

In response to a couple of queries, we want to clarify that while the flu vaccine doesn’t protect against COVID-19 infection, it is still recommended this year for at-risk groups and health care workers, and to prevent an increased load on the health care system from people falling ill with seasonal influenza. Vaccine administration is taking place in a well-distanced outdoor setting, outside the UWA Medical Centre.

More information is available from the Medical Centre webpage.

Changes to Transperth services from Monday 6 April

Transperth has announced a reduction to public transport services.

From Monday 6 April, services will revert to Saturday timetables for all routes. As a result, route 950 will offer a reduced number of services daily, whilst routes 96 and 97 will not operate.

Transperth offers other routes that can be used to access UWA campuses. You can find details of other services and the planned changes on the Transperth website.

Car parking is currently available for free at all UWA car park locations, regardless of whether or not you have a parking permit.

We are living in turbulent times. It feels like we are being inundated with sad news from around the world hourly, if not even more often.

And so to remind you that there is a brighter tomorrow and to keep you working towards that day, some of you may remember this quote from Dr Suess:

“The more that you read, the more things you will know.

The more you can learn, the more places you’ll go."

You are strong and resilient students, you must be, you made it to into UWA. Keep being kind and take care to support each other through this time. They will be your friends for life.

Best,

Jane and Bre
