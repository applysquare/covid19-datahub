[Programs available at UNSW in Term 2 2020(link is external)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/programs-term-2-2020) 

**The University has ceased all in-person classes.**

UNSW has introduced online teaching and learning for most classes to help reduce virus transmission and protect health service provision and ensure business continuity. 

Teachers will deliver classes, where possible, by online or other means that can be accessed remotely. Students should access online teaching material remotely and participate by remote means. In addition, steps are underway to convert some laboratory practicals to video demonstrations or other methods that can accessed remotely. Individual course convenors will inform you of details via Moodle or other means.
