  * Students should access online teaching material remotely and participate by remote means. This is achievable for lectures and for many tutorials and discussions.
  * Students can visit the [IT website (link is external)](https://www.myit.unsw.edu.au/working-and-studying-remotely) or the [transitioning to online learning website(link is external)](https://www.covid19studyonline.unsw.edu.au/) for more information on what programs to use and how to get set up for remote study. 
  * Students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online should contact the UNSW student and staff hotline - 9385 8500.
  * Steps are underway to convert some laboratory practicals to video demonstrations or other methods that can accessed remotely. Individual course convenors will inform you of details via Moodle or other means shortly.
