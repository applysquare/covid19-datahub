No students will be required to undertake face-to-face assessments in Term 1, 2020.  All assessments will be designed so they can be completed remotely. For more information read our [FAQs(link is external)](https://student.unsw.edu.au/grade/changes).

As a result of the work underway to move from invigilated examinations to online and alternative assessments, the release dates for the Term 1 2020 Exam Timetable have been amended.  
  
The new dates are:

  * 3 April at 5.00pm: Release of Provisional Exam Timetable
  * 9 April at 5.00pm: Release of Final Exam Timetable
