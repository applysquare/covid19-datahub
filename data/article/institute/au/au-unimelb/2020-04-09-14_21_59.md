All lectures, tutorials, and interactive seminars are now online and are available through the [Learning Management System (LMS)](https://lms.unimelb.edu.au).

We are waiving any physical attendance requirements that may have been relevant to your subjects at the beginning of the semester. Active class participation requirements will remain in place for the online delivery of your classes, so make sure you check to see if this is a requirement in your subject. Check the LMS for details.
