#### Extension of Semester One and revised 2020 University calendar

The University has extended Semester 1, 2020 by one week, to finish on 7 June 2020. One week of Swot Vac will follow with the three week assessment period now commencing on Monday 15 June. The dates for the Winter study period and Semester 2, 2020 will be pushed back by one week. See [key dates](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/key-dates "https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/key-dates") or [download a detailed revised Academic Calendar](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/3330489/UoM_2020Calendar_V4.pdf).

Please continue to refer to the [Handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/search "https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/search") and [LMS](https://lms.unimelb.edu.au "https://lms.unimelb.edu.au/") for up-to-date information on all non-standard study periods (e.g. intensives, year-long etc) and seek advice from the relevant Subject Coordinator regarding the relevant dates for these subjects.

#### Dates for standard Semester 1 subjects

  * All standard Semester 1 subjects have a revised census date and fee due date of 30 April which is the new due date to access a FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP loan
  * You can withdraw without financial penalty up to and including 30 April
  * You can withdraw without academic penalty up to and including 5 June
  * If you withdraw from subjects after 5 June, you will need to meet the usual criteria for late withdrawal and fee remission in special circumstances
  * There will be no impact to you accessing FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP â€“ the revised census date allows eligible students more time to either pay upfront or access a HELP loan



Scholarship payments that are scheduled for 17 April will not be affected by changes to the revised census date. See [Scholarship Payments](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-support/scholarships-and-financial-support/manage-your-scholarship/about-your-scholarship#payments) for more information on key Scholarship dates.

#### Dates for non-standard Semester 1 subjects

We are reviewing census dates for non-standard subjects commencing prior to 30 June and with a census date of 20 March or later. Where possible we will revise census dates proportionate with the changes made to the standard subject census date.  You will be notified via email to your student account of any changes to the key dates for your enrolled subjects by Friday 17 April.

#### Semester break

  * Week commencing Monday 30 March: one full week of teaching
  * Monday 6 April to Sunday 19 April: extended Easter non-teaching period (commencing four days earlier than previously scheduled).
