To ensure that you are not disadvantaged in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University will make the following changes to its grading system:

  * **Non-graded passes (NGP)** : All students will be given the option to choose whether to have any passing grade converted into a non-graded pass (NGP). If students choose this option, their NGP will not count towards their grade point average (GPA) calculations. Students will be given this option following, rather than prior to, receiving their results.
  * **Fails converted to Withdraw No Fails (WNF)** : All Fail grades will be changed to WNF, which will not be counted towards GPA calculations.
  * **Results Pending (RP):**  RP can be utilised where components of courses are postponed to subsequent semesters/periods.



These changes will be introduced for all students in Semester 1 and Trimester 2, and potentially for the rest of the year if COVID-19 disruptions persist.

Required learning outcomes for courses or programs will not be affected. Students must still achieve their approved learning outcomes to complete a course successfully.

Students can also read the [detailed email announcement](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/covid-19/student-information/student-communications#1-april-2020-covid-19-measures-to-support-students) from Professor Pascale Quester, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic).
