An exchange does not impact your University of Adelaide GPA. Exchange is reflected as credit transferred and exact course credit will be as previously approved by your Faculty and subject to satisfactory completion of courses. If you are aware of recent changes/proposed changes to the content or assessment of approved exchange courses, you should make sure your Adelaide Faculty is aware of these changes and you should discuss any implications with them. 

You can direct any questions about changes to exchange course content and assessment to your host university and your [Adelaide Faculty Advisor](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/study-overseas/faculty-and-advisors) in the first instance. If additional support is required, you can contact [Study Overseas](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/study-overseas/contact-us).
