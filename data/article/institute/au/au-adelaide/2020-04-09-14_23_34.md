Resulting from announcements made by the Federal Government regarding stricter restrictions on travel and mass gatherings, the University will not hold exams as usual this semester.

Instead, all invigilated exams requiring personal attendance will be changed to alternative assessments - without invigilation, administered through MyUni. Example alternatives might include open-book exams, online tests, or written reports.

Changes to assessments (both activity type and weighting) are being determined and will be communicated to you in each course in MyUni. We know that visibility of assessment is very important for you and we apologise for these changes.

If you have any questions regarding this change, please contact [Ask Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/ask-adelaide/) on [+61 8 8313 5208](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/ask-adelaide/contact-us "Phone Us").
