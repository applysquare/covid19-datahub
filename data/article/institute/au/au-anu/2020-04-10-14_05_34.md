We have moved to remote working, teaching, research and studying across ANU.

This arrangement will be in place for the remainder of Semester One - from Thursday 26 March until Saturday 27 June.

University buildings will be locked down from Monday 30 March, and staff will not be able to access their building. If you need to collect something critical (for example, a Medicare card), you can place a request for access with your relevant General Manager or Service Division Director for assessment on whether access to the building where you work for a maximum 10 minutes will be granted. You will not be granted access to collect non-critical items. You can also request approval for access to collect work items if you have been in self-isolation and were unable to attend campus prior to the move to remote working.

Essential health services including ANU Counselling and the National Health Co-op will be available by scheduled appointment for staff and students.

National Health Co-op: Call +61 2 6178 0400 or book an appointment online: https://www.nhc.coop/locations/anu

Setting up working from home arrangements

We understand that some may find it difficult to work from home. We will be flexible and understanding of a variety of circumstances. You will continue to paid as normal during this period.

Hours may be spread out across the week. If you can work at least 25 hours of a 35 hour week (pro-rated for part time staff), this will be deemed a full working week for pay purposes.

All staff should utilise the following resources:

COVID-19 working away from campus guidelines for supervisors and staff are available here. Additionally, there is a checklist for staff.

ITS have developed information on IT aspects of working remotely, including staying connected, passwords, VPN access, and other FAQs. You can view it here: https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/login-access/working-remotely.

Coming soon: a guide on how to set up a home based workstation. If you need advice on this now, please contact whs@anu.edu.au.

We understand that there may be a period of adjustment as we transition to this way of working. We ask your patience as we make this transition.

We are relying on the sense and empathy of supervisors to make decisions about how we can keep people engaged in work.

Office equipment (including IT equipment)

You may take items under 10kg (e.g. your chair) home if you can do so in a safe manner. Please do not take chairs on public transport.

Do not remove any large office equipment such as desks, or sit-to-stand desks to take home.

The University will not be organising removalists or such to remove items from the University to your home.

If you need to purchase furniture at home, you may be able to claim this in your annual tax, but please seek independent advice for your personal situation. The Australian Tax Office website provides advice about tax deductions for work expenses.

If you take equipment home, you will be responsible for returning the equipment at the end of the working away from campus period.

IT desktop equipment

If you do not have an ANU laptop or home computer, please liaise with your supervisor on options before removing any office-based IT equipment. Your supervisor will liaise with your General Manager or Director.

If approved to remove IT equipment from the office, please register the equipment in the Equipment Register Form. Please note you will need to take personal responsibility for this equipment - including safely removing, carrying and installation in your home.

Please note that most desktop equipment does not have wi-fi access so you will not be able to use your desktop at home and connect to the University, without running a cable back to your router and without possibly applying some configuration.

Purchasing IT equipment

The IT and procurement teams are working hard to procure additional laptops. Please be aware due to shortages there may be delays in receiving equipment.

If you need to purchase office equipment at home, you may be able to claim this in your annual tax. The Australian Tax Office website provides advice about tax deductions for work expenses.

Home internet connectivity

The University is unable to provide home internet connectivity or process reimbursements at this point in time.

You may be able to claim this under your annual tax but please seek independent advice for your personal situation. The Australian Tax Office website provides advice about tax deductions for work expenses: https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Deductions-you-can-claim/

While working from home the IT Service Desk can continue to provide support for your ANU provided laptop and equipment. If you are having difficulty with your own provided home internet connection or home computer there are a range of private organisations that you could contact to provide an individual private arrangement. For more information visit the Working Remotely page.

VPN service

The IT team is in the process of rolling out a VPN service for all staff that can be utilised on home computers or ANU managed devices. You will find instructions on this here: https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/login-access/working-remotely.

Please ensure you test your connection from home and if you have any issues that are not covered in the attached link please log a job with Service Desk Portal.

IT support

ITS are currently managing an unprecedented amount of demand. ITS staff are working through this prioritising support for remote working.

To help Service Delivery manage the high call volume please search the IT Knowledge Base prior to logging a ticket with the Service Desk. Your patience is appreciated.

Using technology to stay connected is very important. Zoom meeting software can help.

Childcare centres on campus

Recruitment

There is limited opportunity to onboard new staff at this time, and on that basis we will pause all current and new recruitment.

However, if there are any reasons to make exceptions to this, please contact the Director of HR.
