Student Support: Financial Accommodations Dear Students and Families: We recognize that our students and families are working through many difficult decisions during this health emergency, and we are taking unprecedented steps as a university to support our community. As previously communicated, USD will make considerations to credit room and board charges, parking permits, and the Student Life Pavilion Fee. As determined by the Associated Students Government, the Undergraduate Associated Student Fee will be retained to provide support to students with financial needs that are impacted by this transition. The university is actively monitoring communication from the Department of Education and will finalize the proration of charges in accordance with issued guidance, once available, to minimize the impact on our students and families. The universityâ€™s goal is to ensure that instruction and academic student support continues throughout the semester. If students and families make the decision it is necessary to withdraw from the university, USD has extended the 60% Tuition Refund period from March 11, 2020 to March 20, 2020. If a student withdraws from the university after March 20, 2020, a tuition refund will not be issued. The university intends to prorate room and board charges, parking permits and the Student Life Pavilion Fee using March 13, 2020 as a point-in-time for the calculation; under these assumptions for students on the undergraduate academic calendar, the Spring 2020 Semester is 40% complete based on the total number of class days. USD will pro-rate charges at a 60% credit, rounding to the nearest whole dollar. Students on alternative calendars will receive individualized information about the proration of their charges. One exception will be Dining Dollars; Dining Dollars will be credited based on the actual balance remaining as of the last day used, or March 22, 2020. For any resident student who has been approved to remain on campus, all existing charges will remain in effect. We will continue to keep you informed as information and guidance becomes available. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact finance@sandiego.edu. Sincerely, COVID-19 Action Team
