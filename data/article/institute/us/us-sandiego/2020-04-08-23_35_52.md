Student Support Dear Students: Following the communication from President Harris earlier today, we write to offer additional details related to the universityâ€™s decision of mandatory remote teaching by March 23 and student relocation out of the residence halls by March 22. Financial Accommodations Credit for room and board charges, parking permit fees, and mandatory student fees The Finance Office will arrange pro-rated reimbursement credits of room and board and parking charges; all other fees are being evaluated with the input from Associated Students. We will send information as soon as possible about the process through which these credits will be handled. Student employment We are considering accommodations for students who hold spring semester campus jobs and who had expected to continue receiving wages from their employment. Please bear with us as we assess how to address this situation. Emergency funds If the requirement for you to leave campus creates a financial hardship, you can apply to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, which is able to provide limited assistance to high financial need students who are suffering severe hardships. International students International students who meet the criteria for remaining on campus will not have to return home. If you are an international student, you will receive a separate communication from the USD International Center addressing travel concerns and other important information. General inquiries can be sent to internationaloffice@sandiego.edu. Life on Campus for Those Students Remaining on Campus Dining All students who remain on campus and have a required meal plan will continue to be served in Pavilion Dining, or another dining unit. The hours of operations as of now remain the same. For your protection all buffet food services (self-serve) have been discontinued and are being replaced with to go options. To promote social distancing, meals will be available to take back to your room or you may eat on site. All food options are available for purchase (cash and credit card) if you do not have a meal plan. For current dining hours please visit: www.sandiego.edu/auxiliary Events No final decisions have been made at this time regarding Commencement. Given the uncertain nature of this health crisis, we believe it is premature to cancel Commencement based on the information currently available. The decision to hold or cancel Commencement will be made based on the best public health advice possible, and once made, we will inform the community. Hours of operation Student Health Center, campus libraries, and the University Center/Student Life Pavilion will be open with revised schedules and social distancing protocols in place. Information about extended or reduced hours for these and other facilities will be available next week. Fitness Centers (Bosley, JCP/McNamara and Sports Center, including the pool) will be closed effective March 14, 2020. Mental Health Support If you need mental health support, please contact the Counseling Center. After hours support is available 24/7 by calling 619-260-4655 and selecting option 1. Additional questions can be directed to universitycommunications@sandiego.edu. Sincerely, COVID-19 Action Team
