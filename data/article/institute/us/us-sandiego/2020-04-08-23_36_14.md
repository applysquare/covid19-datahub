Dear USD Campus Community: The World Health Organization announced on March 11, 2020, that the COVID-19 outbreak is now considered a global pandemic. Over the past few weeks, we have been sharing with you how the university was monitoring the Coronavirus outbreak while following our university protocols to mitigate any risks to our campus community. This new designation of COVID-19 as a pandemic requires the university to take even more dramatic steps to scale up our emergency response. While our primary focus remains the health and safety of our campus community and their families, it is abundantly clear that additional actions are necessary as we also wish to reduce the impact on health care systems and allow them to focus on the most vulnerable members of the community. In light of these considerations, the university is mandating campus-wide remote teaching effective March 23, 2020, through the end of the spring semester. In addition, all USD intercollegiate athletic events and club sports are cancelled for the remainder of their respective seasons. We recognize that this unprecedented situation has caused anxiety for our campus and people will need time to make the transition to the remote delivery of our classes. To help us prepare for this new experience, we are cancelling all classes from March 14-22 to enable our faculty and students to prepare for remote teaching and learning. Please know that we are continuing campus operations. We know that living in close proximity to others during a pandemic increases the possibility of transmission of a virus. Therefore, all USD students who live in the residence halls must relocate from campus no later than March 22. Since this transition extends to the end of the semester, students must take all personal items with them so that they can be fully engaged and ready for the academic remote learning experience. We understand there are some students who may have personal hardship, financial hardship or academic reasons to stay on campus, so we are preparing for a limited number of students to remain on campus for the foreseeable future. Those who want to apply to stay on campus or have a hardship in moving all items home, please complete this form. During this transition time, dining options will be provided to our students. The University of San Diego takes great pride in the high-impact learning practices that are the hallmark of a USD experience. While it remains our firm belief that high-impact practices are best delivered in person on our campus, we believe our remarkable faculty and students are capable of rising to the challenge of creating common intellectual experiences through the remote delivery of our curriculum. During these extraordinary times, we need to work together to live out our values, be gracious and patient in our actions toward each other, and rise to the challenges we will face in the weeks and months ahead. As a community, we keep all those impacted by this health emergency in our prayers, especially our students who will be traveling home in the near future. We will continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. Please also refer to our COVID-19 website for the latest information. Peace, James T. Harris III, D.Ed.
