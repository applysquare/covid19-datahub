In response to the University's decision to extend spring break and move to online coursework through April 3rd, 2020, the **University Unions** has made some adjustments to our operations and access.

The Unions will only be available to TCU faculty, staff, and students through card swipe access. The Brown-Lupton University Union will only be accessible via the north and south archway entry and the King Family Commons will only be available at the Information Desk entry.
