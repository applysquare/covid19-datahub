**Online classes will continue through the remainder of the semester.**

TCU Chancellor Victor Boschini, Jr. announced to students, faculty and staff today that online classes and virtual instruction will continue for the remainder of the semester.

“The uncertainty of the spread and duration of COVID-19 in our area means that we must chart a responsible path forward for you, your parents, our faculty and staff, and our full community,” Chancellor Boschini said in an email to students March 19.“You’ll soon start receiving activities and news from Student Affairs to keep you connected during our time apart. It would be difficult to replicate the singular experience that the TCU campus offers, but we are going to do everything we can to maintain our purple connections. We will be together in spirit, if not in person.”

Online classes and virtual instruction will begin Monday, March 23.
