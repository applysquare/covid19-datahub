The University has released guidance to resident students on safety precautions and notification process with respect to COVID-19, in the form of a message from Richard Gatteau, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Dallas W. Bauman, Assistant Vice President for Campus Residences and Marisa Bisiani, Assistant Vice President for Student Health, Wellness, and Prevention Services. The message reads as follows:

President Bernstein sent an email to the campus community on Saturday night advising that we have started to see confirmed COVID-19 cases at Stony Brook. Currently, we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among our 2,000 residents who continue to live and study in campus housing, but we anticipate that as testing increases, there will be positive COVID-19 cases among our resident community. We are committed to providing care should you become sick with COVID-19 or any other health issue. In addition, should another resident become sick, we will follow our protocol related to care and communication as detailed below.

What precautions should I take to be healthy and safe?

Please take the following steps to protect yourself and others. Your personal hygiene is crucial in curbing the spread of this virus:

Maintain social distancing at all times (6 feet apart from others)

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks

If you share a bathroom with others, clean all surfaces before and after use

Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze

Avoid close contact with people who are sick

Stay in your room if you are sick and avoid contact with others

What should I do if I am sick?

If you are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention right away. Call Student Health at 631-632-6740 to speak with a healthcare professional who will advise you on appropriate next steps.

If you become ill and test positive for COVID-19, Campus Residences and Student Health Services will assign you to a single room in a separate residence hall, apart from any other residents, for a self-isolation period of 14 days (or more, depending upon symptoms). Ongoing care will be provided to you from Student Health Services and CAPS, and meals will be delivered to your building from Campus Dining.

What happens if someone in our residential community is diagnosed with COVID-19?

Upon confirming a resident is positive for COVID-19, Student Health Services will begin a contact investigation and work with our local Department of Health to identify and notify those who have come in close contact with the student, such as roommates, suitemates and apartment mates. These close contacts will be notified expeditiously by Student Health and provided directions as to the necessary steps to be taken. Confidentiality of the student with COVID-19 will be maintained. In addition, our facilities staff will be notified and promptly follow the necessary cleaning protocol.

We care about you and all of our students. Thank you for continuing to do your part to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
