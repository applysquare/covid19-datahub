RECENT UPDATES

Message to Graduate Students re: Summer Sessions

April 4, 2020



The University has issued a message to graduate students regarding plans to move Summer Sessions online. Signed by Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost and Senior Vice-President for Academic Affairs; Kenneth Kaushansky, Dean, School of Medicine and Senior Vice President for Health Sciences; and Eric Wertheimer, Vice Provost for Graduate and Professional Education and Dean of the Graduate School, the message reads as follows:

The University is beginning to make plans for the upcoming academic terms, continuing to hold your health and well-being as our top priority.

With this in mind, we have decided to move all classes for Summer Session I and II online. There may be rare exceptions to this policy, and on-campus courses will be noted as such in the course listings. Courses involving clinical experiences for professional licensure in the Health Sciences either within the Stony Brook University Hospital system or at alternate locations will be offered as permitted.

Faculty are being asked to prioritize offering the courses that are required for graduation, so you can continue progressing toward your degree in a timely manner.

To further protect your health and safety, and that of the entire University community, graduate-level research that can be conducted remotely will continue. All research that requires an on-campus presence has been suspended at this time. If you are engaged in an active research project and are unsure what role you may play remotely, we encourage you to contact your supervisor.

Across the University, we continue to examine our operations and make decisions about policy and future activity to protect everyone’s health and safety. We are coordinating closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Governor’s Office, SUNY, and other key stakeholders. Please be aware that decisions like the one outlined above should be expected over the coming weeks and months.

We deeply appreciate your understanding and your willingness to adapt to these changing and difficult circumstances.

Message to Faculty re: managing Zoom classroom disruptions

April 3, 2020

Charles L. Robbins, Vice Provost Undergraduate Education and Student Success/Dean of the Undergraduate Colleges, has released further guidance to faculty on managing disruptions of Zoom classrooms. The message reads as follows:

We appreciate how hard you have worked to transition your courses to remote delivery. As I am sure you are aware, Zoom classes and meetings across the country have been disrupted by unruly individuals using hateful speech and images. You have received some guidance on how to secure your class and reduce the likelihood of these disruptions (see Prevent and Manage Disruptions in Your Zoom Sessions). Be sure to take the steps necessary to secure your Zoom class; if you require set up assistance, please refer to this site or email CELT@stonybrook.edu. Although unlikely, it is still possible that your class could be disrupted.

In addition to the guidance recommended above, there are additional steps you should take to secure your classroom and ensure a safe and appropriate learning environment for everyone.

Inform your class that you and the University expect a learning environment built on civility and mutual respect. Indicate that any actions that diverge from this expectation will be dealt with swiftly. Inform students that most classes are typically recorded and those who violate these principles will be identified and referred to the Office of University Community Standards and/or Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity. If found responsible, students can face discipline ranging from a warning to a suspension or expulsion from the University. Facilitating another person’s entry into the class with the purpose of disruption is also a serious violation of the Code of Student Responsibility.

If there is a disruption in your class, please take the necessary steps to keep control of your class. Your students need to see you maintain your composure and model authority. It is equally important that you not end the class. That sends the wrong message to the students, who deserve to have your full attention and see a resolution. Try to use this as a teaching moment in students’ professional development.

Familiarize yourself with these steps:

Prevent participants from screen sharing – click the arrow next to “Share Screen”, and then select Advanced Sharing Options. Under “Who can share?”, select Only Host.

Mute the participant, click Manage Participants. A tab called Participants should appear on the right. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Mute.

Stop the participant’s video – click Manage Participants. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Stop Video.

Remove the participant – click Manage Participants. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Remove.

Lock the meeting – Once a meeting is locked, no one else can join. To lock your meeting: click Manage Participants. Click More in the bottom right. Click Lock Meeting.

After the class, contact stonybrook.edu/reportit or communitystandards@stonybrook.edu. If appropriate contact University Police.

If problems persist, please let the Provost’s Office know so that we can assist you.

Interim President issues video message on Commencement 2020

April 2, 2020

Interim President Michael Bernstein has shared a video message with students, faculty and staff regarding this year’s Commencement. The message reads as follows:



I have an important and poignant message to share with the members of the Class of 2020. Amidst all the challenges that have come your way due to the COVID-19 pandemic — the abrupt transition to on-line learning, the imposition of strict social-distancing protocols that have cancelled campus events and activities, the fearsome threat of the coronavirus itself, to name a few — it is now also clear that we will not be able to hold our Spring Commencement ceremony in person on Friday, May 22.

We have made this difficult decision in a deliberate and careful way with input from our medical experts, and in conformity with guidelines established by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Governor’s Office of the State of New York.

Our choice ensures the well-being of our community and loved ones.

I assure you all appropriately completed degrees will be conferred as scheduled – and, as needed, information will be forwarded to professional licensing bodies. You should expect receipt of your formal diplomas within two months of your graduation date.

As I know you are aware, countless graduation celebrations are now being reimagined nationwide for the Class of 2020. These unexpected and disheartening circumstances will not, of course, make these occasions any less significant nor less joyous. The accomplishments we will celebrate on your behalf will always be real and vivid.

In this regard, I want to thank you for gifting us a moment of joy during an otherwise extremely difficult time. It is important to remember that even now, exciting milestones are still reached. Your accomplishments will lift our spirits immensely.

We have begun assessing alternatives for the May Commencement Ceremony. A team of University faculty, staff, and students are evaluating several options. I particularly want to thank the USG and GSO leadership for providing their insights in this effort and for working to secure the input of their peers. Of course, as decisions are made, you will receive timely updates from the University Commencement Office through your Stony Brook University e-mail address.

Whatever ultimate arrangements we make, it is also our intention that on May 22 itself, we will bring together our graduating class in a virtual setting so that we may formally bestow your degrees. Details about this event will be forthcoming.

I am very sorry that your final semester at Stony Brook has been derailed by this tragic public health crisis. And I want to thank all of you who in so many ways have supported our community as we confront this unprecedented emergency. It’s that very spirit for which your class – the Class of 2020 — will always be uniquely known.

University releases message on changes to Summer Sessions

April 2, 2020

Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost and Senior Vice-President for Academic Affairs, has issued a message to students regarding changes to Summer Session. The message reads as follows:

As we finalize our preparations for the rest of this semester, we are beginning plans for the coming academic terms. As we make these decisions, we continue to hold your health and well-being, and that of the entire University community, as our top priority.

You have just received an email with information about Summer and Fall registration. As a follow-up to this communication, I write to confirm that almost all undergraduate classes during Summer Sessions I and II will be offered online only. Exceptions may be made in very rare cases; any courses offered on campus will be identified in the summer course listings. All faculty are being asked to prioritize moving online any courses that are required for graduation to ensure that you can continue progressing toward your degree in a timely manner.

To prioritize the safety of our community by minimizing on-campus density, we are suspending all in-person undergraduate research projects. Undergraduate students may conduct their research virtually if the option is available, but cannot come to campus for research-related activities.

The University Administration is continuing to examine our operations and procedures to ensure everyone’s health and safety. We are coordinating closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Governor’s Office, SUNY, and other key stakeholders. Please expect similar announcements in the weeks and months ahead.

We all deeply appreciate your understanding and your willingness to adapt to these changing circumstances.

Message regarding incivility in online classrooms

March 31, 2020

The University has issued a message to the community regarding incivility in online classrooms. Signed by Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost and Senior Vice-President for Academic Affairs; Judith Brown Clarke, Chief Diversity Officer; Richard J. Gatteau, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students; Charles L. Robbins, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and Student Success/Dean of the Undergraduate Colleges and Eric Wertheimer, Dean and Vice Provost of the Graduate School, the message reads as follows:

Some of you have raised concerns about offensive and inappropriate content being shared in your Zoom classrooms. It is unfortunate that you have to deal with these issues, on top of leaving campus, taking classes online, and worrying about your health and that of your loved ones. Thank you for stepping forward. These occurrences are unacceptable and run counter to our core institutional values.

Stony Brook University, like universities around the country, is actively working to address and prevent these instances of Zoom Intruding in our classes and meetings. We remain as committed as ever to maintaining an inclusive, welcoming, and respectful learning environment for all of our students, no matter the class format.

You are a valued member of our diverse community. Our students, faculty, and staff represent all races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and abilities -- and we benefit from all perspectives. We are committed to maintaining the dignity, respect, and fair treatment of all members of our community. Any action that stigmatizes an individual or a group of people, including expressions of xenophobia, will not be tolerated.

The Code of Student Responsibility applies on and off campus. Any student who is found to behave inappropriately in these online platforms will be held accountable. If you have been targeted or experienced discrimination of any kind, including xenophobia, report these incidents to the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity .

We have made significant and universal changes to Zoom accounts for all faculty and staff. These changes aim to prevent non-SBU individuals from joining classes and meetings, and they will have a minor impact on your Zoom experience:

To join a class, you will have to log in using your SBU credentials

Do not share Zoom links with others or post links on social media

Only instructors will have the ability to share their screens; if you are expected to give a presentation, your instructor will give you access as needed

Zoom classes are recorded. Offensive activities will be reviewed and addressed through our student conduct process.

Faculty can also remove disruptive participants who are having a detrimental effect on the learning environment.

We expect everyone to work together to keep our classrooms safe and productive. Most importantly, if something happens in one of your classes, please ReportIt . It is our goal to ensure a collaborative and respectful learning environment for all.
