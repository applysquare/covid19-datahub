This message to all faculty and staff has been approved by Dr. Gary K. Ostrander, Vice President for Research.

The Office of Research will have a second All-Campus Zoom Meeting on Research Activity on Tuesday, March 31, at 1:30 pm. As we did last time, the meeting will begin with brief updates from VP Ostrander and AVPs Fulkerson and Peluso. We will then open the remainder of the meeting for Q&A. You will all be muted when you come into the meeting and you will have the opportunity to pose questions, which will be answered in real time, via the “Chat Function.” You are encouraged to only post questions that are of general interest to the group.

Should you have specific questions related to issues you are encountering or anticipate encountering, please email Gary (gary@fsu.edu), Laurel (lfulkerson@fsu.edu ), or Kerry (kpeluso@fsu.edu ) as appropriate and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
