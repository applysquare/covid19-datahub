This message to all students, faculty and staff has been approved by Dr. Mark Riley, dean of The Graduate School.

The Graduate School at Florida State University has announced a temporary waiver of entrance exams for all master’s and specialist programs for the Fall 2020 application term, to eliminate potential obstacles for prospective students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The measure, approved by both the Graduate Policy Committee and the Faculty Senate this week, helps to remove a barrier for current and potential applicants by not requiring two key tests that are normally mandatory for many programs — the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).

By waiving the exams, the university aims to incentivize current undergraduates who are graduating in the spring or summer and people hoping to advance their careers to consider pursuing an advanced degree.

Florida State’s deadline for graduate admissions is July 1.
