This message to all faculty and staff has been approved by Dr. Janet Kistner, Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement.

In these unprecedented and stressful times, everyone is adjusting to a “new normal” in which change seems the only constant. Yet one thing that has not changed is FSU’s commitment to academic integrity. The Academic Honor Policy, with some temporary flexibility built in for Spring 2020 cases, is fully operational.

Please continue to send any inquiries, Step 1 Agreements, and Step 2 Hearing Referrals to Ms. Ann DelRossi (adelrossi@fsu.edu) in the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement. To indicate students’ agreement on Step 1 forms, simply forward the student’s email agreeing to the violation and the sanction to Ann with the Step 1 attached. You can find helpful information about academic integrity here: https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy

The Office of Faculty Development and Advancement is committed to supporting faculty and to giving additional flexibility to students during this stressful time. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about either general policies or specific cases. Students with questions about the Academic Honor Policy should be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for assistance. They can be reached at 850/644-5136 or srr@admin.fsu.edu.
