Message to Students and Parents: Student Refund Plan

Date:

March 20, 2020

To:

University of Georgia Students and Parents/Guardians

From:

Jere W. Morehead, President

Jack Hu, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs

Ryan Nesbit, Vice President for Finance and Administration

Victor Wilson, Vice President for Student Affairs

Thank you once again for your understanding as the University of Georgia diligently works to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the University community. We are striving to be attentive in responding to all of your concerns and questions as swiftly as possible, and we appreciate your continued patience and grace as we respond to this unprecedented event and prepare to continue the excellent learning experience you expect.

In response to guidance provided by the University System of Georgia (USG) with respect to refunding of housing, dining, and other fees for Spring 2020, the University of Georgia has requested and received approval from the USG to implement a Student Refund Plan for students who have paid or been assessed these fees for the Spring 2020 semester, with the following considerations:

March 16 is considered the last service date for the services referenced below.

Since the Spring Semester was approximately halfway through as of March 16 (54%, to be exact), 46% of the Athletic, Green, Recreation, and Transportation Fees will be refunded.

Additionally:

UGA will refund 46% of the portion of the Student Center Facility Fee not committed to debt service obligations associated with the Tate Center Renovation and Expansion project (30% of this fee is not committed to the debt service).

The University will refund 46% of the portion of the Student Activity Fee that supports programming and events (25% of this fee supports student programming and events).

In recognition of reduced in-person access to the University Health Center, UGA will refund 10% of the Health Fee. The University Health Center will remain fully staffed and operational throughout the Spring semester, continuing to serve all UGA students through remote and telemedicine platforms for those away from campus as well as in-person access for students who remain on campus and in the local community. Additionally, the University Health Center is a major resource in the University and local community’s ever-evolving response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consistent with the USG guidance, UGA will not provide refunds for tuition, the Special Institutional Fee, the Technology Fee, or the ConnectUGA Fee, as these remain critical in supporting continuity of instruction and associated support. Separately, students who choose to withdraw entirely will be refunded in accordance with UGA’s normal refund schedule, which can be found at https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refunds_spring_undergrad_2020.pdf.

For University Housing residents, students on the Dining Services meal plan, and students with parking permits, the University has requested and received approval to implement refunds, with the following considerations:

March 16 is considered the last service date for the services referenced below.

For University Housing residents, UGA will refund the respective Spring semester rate per individual resident based on their number of unutilized bed nights and the specific rate for the residence hall in which they lived.

For students on the Residential Dining Services meal plan, 46% of the respective Spring semester rate will be refunded. Commuter (Block Plans) will be refunded based on the unused balance of meals. Any remaining Paw Point balances for Spring 2020 will also be refunded.

Students with parking permits will receive refunds based on days remaining on the student’s permit from March 16 forward.

More details about this Student Refund Plan, including dollar amounts and refund schedules, may be found at https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refund/, which will continue to be updated as information becomes available. We did not include specific dollar amounts in this email because each student’s refund amount and schedule are unique, and we want to keep this initial communication succinct and clear.

We expect to begin issuing refunds the week of March 30, and the process will most likely continue through April 10. This rolling timeline will allow us to calculate refund amounts, ensure all refunds are compliant with financial aid rules based on Department of Education guidance, and give students time to verify their refund profile in Athena. The most efficient way to receive your refund is via direct deposit.

If you have not updated your Athena student account refund profile, please do so by March 30, 2020. Visit http://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/athena_refund_profile_setup.pdf for instructions to set up or verify your banking information. If your refund profile is not established, the University will mail your refund to you. Please ensure this mailing address in your Athena account is updated by March 30, 2020, if a mailed check is preferred.

Refunds associated with Study Abroad/Study Away programs that have been suspended or cancelled are in process and will be issued on an ongoing basis. You will receive a separate communication once refunds for these programs are finalized.

We understand you may have questions about this process, and we invite you to submit those to stuacct@uga.edu; we will respond as swiftly as possible. Again, thank you for your patience as we work to provide care and attention to each individual, which necessarily takes some time.

Students may expect further communication about online instruction as well as available student services, support and care, and we encourage you to share these communications with your parents and guardians as you receive them. Direct communication with students is our primary and most effective method for getting this information to both students and parents.

Students, please pay close attention to your email inboxes and refer to UGA coronavirus website for the most up-to-date information about campus services, classes and ongoing developments.

Once again, thank you for your understanding during this unprecedented and challenging time. We are strengthened by witnessing the undaunted determination of students and their families to continue learning, to progress in their education, and to make this the best educational experience possible. Our faculty and staff are earnestly working alongside you in this effort.

Thank you.
