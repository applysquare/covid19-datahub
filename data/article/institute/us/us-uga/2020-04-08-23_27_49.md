We continue to work to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in our campus and community and appreciate the understanding of our faculty, staff and students as we move forward in those efforts. We are writing to share with you the latest update from the University System of Georgia regarding our operations for the remainder of the Spring semester.



Further details will be forthcoming from the University of Georgia over the next few days.



PLEASE NOTE: Per the USG instructions, students may not return to campus to retrieve their belongings at this time. We will work to develop a coordinated plan for this process that incorporates social distancing, and we will communicate this plan shortly.

For Immediate Release from University System of Georgia

The University System of Georgia (USG) has decided that all 26 institutions will move to online instruction for all courses for the remainder of the semester with extremely limited exceptions. This action comes following last weekâ€™s decision to suspend instruction for two weeks to ensure business and instructional continuity, and to allow further state assessment of COVID-19.



Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.



Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere. Students will receive specific instructions from campus leaders regarding when they will be allowed to return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students must follow those instructions. For those students who are unable to depart campus, we will make every effort to accommodate these students.



USG will be providing guidance to campuses on refunds for housing, dining, and other services. Students should wait for their campus to contact them.



Institutions will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.



In the end, we want to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are safe; that we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia; and that we fulfill our mission to graduate our students even in the face of these challenging times.
