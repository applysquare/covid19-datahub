As we move into our second week of online instruction, it is important to emphasize the commitment and pride that each of you has embodied since becoming a member of the UGA community. Your continued obligation to comply with the Code of Conduct is paramount in this challenging environment as we work together to help you continue your stellar academic pursuits. Whether you are isolating, participating in a Zoom class, or working virtually with a group of students on a project, remember that the Code of Conduct is still applicable.

The Office of Student Conduct, the Office of Academic Honesty and the Equal Opportunity Office are currently working remotely but are available to you online to discuss any issues that arise and to report any potential violation. The office email addresses are:

Office of Student Conduct – conduct@uga.edu

Office of Academic Honesty – honesty@uga.edu

Equal Opportunity Office – ugaeoo@uga.edu
