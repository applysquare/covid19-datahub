Student Refunds and the Opportunity to Help Students in Need

Date:

March 30, 2020

To:

University of Georgia Students and Parents and Guardians

From:

Jere W. Morehead, President

Kelly Kerner, Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations

The University has received several inquiries from both students and parents who want to donate a portion of their refund to assist fellow students with significant financial need during these challenging times. While student financial aid and other student sponsorship requirements restrict the University from being able to receive a contribution directly from your student refund, there are other ways to donate, if desired.

You can click on this link to learn more about how to assist your fellow students during this time. If you have questions about a donation, please contact Sara Cook (saracook@uga.edu).

We offer our thanks to the students and parents who requested this option and to those who are able and desire to participate. Refunds to students will begin to be made on a rolling basis on April 2 and will most likely continue through April 10.
