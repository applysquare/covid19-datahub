March 20, 2020

NJIT Community Members,

Allow me to provide you with updates regarding Commencement and credits for housing, meal plans, and parking.

Commencement

Our Commencement marks an annual highlight for the entire NJIT community and is particularly meaningful for the students who graduate that day, as well as to their families and loved ones. The members of the Class of 2020 should be sharing milestones and traditions with one another this Spring but cannot because of what is an unprecedented threat to our collective wellbeing. At a time when it is our university community's strong desire to come together, it is absolutely necessary that we remain physically apart. I am committing to you, though, that NJIT will do two things with the Class of 2020. First, NJIT will work to develop a virtual commencement on the previously scheduled dates that will be as meaningful and engaging as possible. Second, NJIT will plan to honor the Class of 2020 with an in-person Commencement ceremony at such a time as it is safe. The determination of how and when to accomplish this will be informed by the guidance provided by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Task Force and its advisory committee, which includes student, faculty and staff representatives from throughout our campus community.

Housing, Meal Plans, and Parking Credits

Students who reside in campus housing and/or have purchased meal plans and/or have paid for parking on campus for the Spring 2020 semester will receive prorated housing, meal plan, and parking credits to their student account for the period of Monday, March 23 through Friday, May 15 due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial aid and scholarship policies may impact your credit. Details regarding the terms and conditions of the credit, and refunds to graduating students, will be posted to the Bursar’s and Financial Aid websites no later than March 27.

A True Community

NJIT community members, though we are separated at this time, we know that we are part of a large and close-knit community. These are stressful and difficult times, but we have and will continue to support one another as we work through the challenges we face. Thank you all for your commitment to NJIT and your hard work. We look forward to the time when we will be in one another’s company again. Please stay safe and well.

Sincerely,

NJIT President Joel S. Bloom
