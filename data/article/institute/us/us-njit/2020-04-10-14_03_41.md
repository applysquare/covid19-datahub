Dear NJIT Community Members,

The Office of Residence Life recently was informed that an on-campus resident student who had previously returned home internationally has since tested positive for COVID-19. NJIT's facilities team has disinfected campus spaces that were visited by this community member, and the university has identified and informed, to the best of its ability, all members of the campus community who may have come in recent contact with the student who tested positive. Additionally, and per CDC guidelines, those notified of possible contact were directed to self-quarantine for 14 days from their last known contact and monitor their health.

For those residing on-campus who needed to self-quarantine, those residents have self-quarantined in place to mitigate transmission concerns and have been provided all necessary resources, including food, water, and other requested items, while they attend classes virtually. It is important to note that none of these students have tested positive for COVID-19 or reported any symptoms thus far.

While we will continue to communicate pertinent information, it is not our intent to distribute a campus message in each instance of an NJIT community member testing positive for COVID-19. We do want to encourage those who test positive to notify the NJIT COVID-19 Task Force by completing the form at https://forms.gle/EuQZQaaaJYTA6H8J8 or by notifying the Office of Human Resources (employees) or the Office of the Dean of Students (students). As soon as any notification is received by NJIT, the university will move aggressively to complete the steps outlined below:

NJIT will determine, to the best of its ability, when and where the community member's most recent visits to campus occurred. NJIT will notify, to the best of its ability, all known members of the campus community with whom contact/exposure may have occurred. NJITâ€™s facilities team will disinfect the campus spaces determined to have been visited by the community member who tested positive for COVID-19.

We continue to encourage members of the NJIT community to practice social distancing and to follow the guidance of the CDC offered here with regard to prevention, including washing hands frequently. Thank you for your cooperation as we work together to provide for the health and wellness of the NJIT community.

Regards,

Andrew P. Christ
