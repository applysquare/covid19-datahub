Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

Today’s coronavirus update summarizes the current status at Elon, reminds you of the important actions taken over the past week, updates you with current information, describes the decisions and communication you can expect moving forward, and reminds us of the medical guidance related to coronavirus. The message is long – thank you for taking the time to read it carefully.

**Current status in the state and the university**

  * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has joined with other federal agencies to release a new coronavirus website: <https://www.coronavirus.gov/>
  * As announced Saturday, March 21, we are aware of one confirmed COVID-19 case among the Elon community – a study abroad student who returned to the United States on March 12, went directly home, and did not come to the Elon campus. The student is recovering in isolation at home and has not required hospitalization.
  * There have been [297 confirmed cases](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc) of COVID-19 in the [state of North Carolina](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina), including two in Alamance County. No COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.
  * The university has shifted to remote instruction for all undergraduate courses, with graduate and law programs operating under specific instructions from their academic deans. Regular in-person instruction is currently projected to resume Monday, April 20.
  * Elon facilities are closed to walk-in traffic through Sunday, April 5, and most services are operating remotely or by appointment. Staff members have been encouraged to work remotely wherever possible.
  * Essential in-person operations available for students who remain on campus include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu here), Student Health Services (appointment information here), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10am – 2pm), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6am – midnight.



**Important announcements from the past week**

  * Elon has implemented a pass/fail option for spring 2020 undergraduate courses. Additional information and links to frequently asked questions can be found online [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/03/22/elon-adopts-new-pass-fail-policy-for-2020-spring-semester/).

  * The Town of Elon has enacted [a number of new regulations](https://www.townofelon.com/covid-19-coronavirus-information/) as part of a State of Emergency declaration over the weekend. Among them, the Town of Elon has prohibited all private and public gatherings of more than ten people. Students living off-campus are advised that Town of Elon police plan to strictly enforce the new restrictions and will not offer warnings before issuing citations.



**Current news and information**

  * Undergraduate students were asked to register with the university if they will be living here, either on-campus or off-campus, between now and April 20. Specific updates about campus services will be sent to those students via email. If students still need to register, or their status has changed, the registration can be updated online by logging into the housing self service portal here: [www.elon.edu/myhousing](http://www.elon.edu/myhousing)
  * The Elon community is invited and encouraged to build community and foster strong relationships by continuing the weekly College Coffee tradition in a virtual format. Check out information online [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/living-and-learning/dining-engagement/college-coffee/) for ideas to connect with Elon friends, mentors, colleagues, and alumni each Tuesday morning for the rest of the semester. Share your College Coffee connections on social media, using the hashtag #ElonStayingConnected
  * University-related international travel has been canceled for Summer 2020. Students with questions about study abroad programs should contact the [Global Education Center](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/global-education-center/), and those with questions about international fellowships should contact their respective program or the [Office of National and International Fellowships](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/national-and-international-fellowships/). Questions about faculty or staff international travel should be directed to your respective dean or vice president.
  * Currently, Fall 2020 international travel-embedded courses and Winter Term 2021 programs are proceeding, but with a modified application timeline. The Global Education Center (GEC) will announce [global short-term programs](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/global-education-center/global-engagement/explore/short-term-programs/status/) on Tuesday, March 24 and will open the Early Action application period from April 21 to May 5.

  * University leaders will closely monitor the trajectory of the coronavirus over the coming weeks, as well as the guidance from public health officials, and will communicate a final decision about the planned April 20 resumption of in-person classes no later than Monday, April 6.
  * Many individuals have asked about [Undergraduate Commencement](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/), scheduled for May 22, and the various graduate program ceremonies [scheduled throughout that week](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/schedule/). Multiple scenarios are being reviewed and final decisions are expected to be announced no later than April 6.
  * We have received inquiries about whether Elon will allow students to request partial credits on housing and/or meal plan costs. The university is considering potential options and expects to have more information available by April 20.
  * Community update emails are scheduled to go out every Monday at 2 p.m. and the special [university coronavirus websit](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/)e is updated continually as new announcements and information is available.

**Staying healthy – and vigilant**

The CDC has [very clear guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html) for how to prevent the spread of coronavirus and protect yourself and others. Key to these recommendations is “social distancing” – avoiding crowds or large gatherings; maintaining at least 6-feet of distance from others; avoiding handshakes or other forms of touching; and regularly washing your hands or using hand sanitizer.

**All members of the Elon community who are on campus   are strongly reminded to be vigilant about these practices. Because of the highly social and relational environment, college campuses can be prime locations for viruses to spread.** Please lead the way as global citizens and carefully follow the advice of public health officials.

**If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough and shortness of breath):**

  * Do not go out and do not come in contact with others.
  * If you are a student living on campus or in the Elon area, call (do not visit) Student Health Services at 336-278-7230 during operational hours, or the Cone Health/Alamance Regional Medical Center at 336-538-7050 when Student Health Services is closed. If you are not in the Elon area, call your medical provider or local hospital emergency room for directions.
  * If you are a faculty or staff member, you should call your primary care provider. If you do not have one, contact Faculty/Staff Health & Wellness Clinic at 336-278-5569.



**Our next email update to the community is planned for next Monday afternoon, March 30, at 2:00 p.m., unless an earlier message is warranted.** Current information is always available on the special university website: <https://www.elon.edu/coronavirus>.
