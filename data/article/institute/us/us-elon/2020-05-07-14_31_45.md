Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

This week’s Monday update summarizes the current status in North Carolina and at the university, provides an update on future planning efforts, and provides important student information for the spring semester.

Current status

  * There have been [9,142 laboratory-confirmed cases](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc) of COVID-19 in the [state of North Carolina](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina), including 91 in Alamance County.  A total of 306 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.
  * There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Elon students, faculty, or staff who have been on campus during a possible period of contagion. The university will continue to report positive cases in accordance with county, state, national and international guidelines. Students on campus or in the area with symptoms that may indicate COVID-19 will be referred for testing using county and state protocols and may be advised to self-isolate to protect the health and safety of the community.
  * Last Thursday, Governor Cooper announced an [extension](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO135-Extensions.pdf) of the North Carolina [stay-at-home executive order](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf) until May 8, and he also announced a [three-phase plan](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf) for reopening businesses in the state of North Carolina.



**Planning for the future**

In addition to the efforts of the Emergency Operations Center, President Connie Book has tasked two additional committees to create plans for the anticipated return to campus.  A committee chaired by Dr. Jeff Stein and Associate Vice-President Kelli Shuman are working to establish policies and protocols for employees to return to campus in the coming weeks  in conjunction with Governor Cooper’s executive orders.

Additionally, President Book has created a Task Force on Fall Semester 2020 and asked President Emeritus Leo M. Lambert to chair that effort. The committee began meeting last week and [established three working groups](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/#ui-id-1) to address the arrival of students in the fall:

  * Instruction and the Classroom, Lab and Studio
  * Health and Safety
  * The Campus Experience, Alumni, and External Communities



The task force will be recommending several options to President Book for the university to “return this fall to Elon’s engaged and personal approach to teaching and learning as we implement significant modifications of the campus environment, daily operations and personal practices.” Watch Elon’s [coronavirus website](http://www.elon.edu/coronavirus) for a link to the Task Force website, where you can contribute suggestions and ideas to support this important work.

**Information for undergraduates moving out of on-campus or off-campus housing**

As students return to campus to pick up belongings in the coming weeks, we urge everyone to follow appropriate public health guidance, to protect the health and safety of university employees, students who are still on campus and others who are moving out. This includes the following:

  * Do not travel to campus if you are feeling ill.
  * Practice physical distancing and do not plan to reunite with friends, host gatherings or remain on campus longer than necessary. (State and local orders currently prohibit all public or private gatherings of more than ten people and are being actively enforced.)
  * Wear a mask and practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing or use of hand sanitizer.
  * Clean and disinfect surfaces, door handles, etc. when moving out.
  * Limit the number of individuals coming with you to assist with move-out and plan to make only one trip to campus to do so.
  * Roommates should coordinate their move-out to occur at different times so that proper physical distancing measures can be observed.



Information related to moving out of on-campus residences can be found on the Residence Life website [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/residence-life/moveout2020/).

**Celebration of undergraduate research**

This is the week of the semester we normally celebrate undergraduate research at the university.  Although we won’t be able to gather for SURF Day, this week the university will launch a new web page to showcase the groundbreaking research that Elon students and their mentors are undertaking. Students from a wide range of disciplines have submitted posters, videos and other content highlighting their research projects and what participating in undergraduate research has meant to them. Watch for a link to the page on the [Today at Elon website](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/).
