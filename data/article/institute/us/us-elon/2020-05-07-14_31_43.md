Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

Today Governor Roy Cooper [announced](https://governor.nc.gov/news/governor-extends-stay-home-order-through-may-8-plans-three-phase-lifting-restrictions-based) an extension of the executive order directing North Carolina residents to stay at home to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The [previous order](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf), which took effect March 30 was effective for 30 days and the [current action](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO135-Extensions.pdf) extends this order through May 8.

**What does this extension mean for campus facilities and operations?**

The operational changes that have been in effect at Elon will continue through May 8, in compliance with Governor Cooper’s order. Remote learning continues, Elon facilities will remain closed to walk-in traffic, and most services will continue operating remotely or by appointment.

Essential services available on campus include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu [here](https://www.elondining.com/menu-hours/)), Student Health Services (hours and appointment information [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/)), Faculty/Staff Health & Wellness Clinic (hours and appointment information [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/bft/wellness/)), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. – 2 p.m.), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 a.m. – midnight.

Students who are still here, either on-campus or nearby, are reminded that the state and local orders prohibiting all public and private gatherings of more than ten (10) people remain in effect. Town of Elon police have been strictly enforcing these orders and will continue to do so.

**What does this extension mean for employee remote work agreements, pandemic leave, and return to work?**

Faculty and staff members will continue working remotely, unless they are providing essential services for the campus and the students who were unable to leave due to personal circumstances. **The previously approved remote work agreements and pandemic leave will be automatically extended through May 8 and no action is needed on the part of employees.**

As we indicated previously, an ad hoc **Return to Work Committee** led by Jeff Stein, vice president for strategic initiatives and partnerships, and Kelli Shuman, associate vice president for human resources, is planning for the return to on-campus work for university employees. This committee will be reviewing today’s announced [three-phase plans](https://governor.nc.gov/news/governor-extends-stay-home-order-through-may-8-plans-three-phase-lifting-restrictions-based) for easing restrictions and reopening businesses across the state as they finalize their recommendations for Elon’s return to work. Details of those university policies and guidelines will be announced when they are completed and approved.

**What does this extension mean for moving out of the residence halls and university apartments?**

As with the current North Carolina stay-at-home directive, relocation activities continue to be permitted. The previously announced information about [spring 2020 move-out](https://www.elon.edu/u/residence-life/moveout2020/) from residence halls and university apartments will not need revision. **Students should communicate their intentions for moving out through the “Student Move-Out Plans” form in the housing portal,[www.elon.edu/myhousing](http://www.elon.edu/myhousing) by tomorrow, April 24.**

As students return to campus to pick up belongings in the coming weeks, we urge all students and families to follow appropriate public health guidance, to protect the health and safety of university employees, students who are still on campus, and others who are moving out. This includes the following:

  * Do not travel to campus if you are feeling ill.
  * Practice physical distancing and do not plan to reunite with friends, host gatherings or remain on campus longer than necessary. (State and local orders currently prohibit all public or private gatherings of more than ten people and are being actively enforced.)
  * Wear a mask and practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing or use of hand sanitizer.
  * Clean and disinfect surfaces, door handles, etc. when moving out.
  * Limit the number of individuals coming with you to assist with move-out and plan to make only one trip to campus to do so.
  * Roommates should coordinate their move-out so that proper physical distancing measures can be observed.



Students who prefer to move out of their residence without returning to the area can receive contact information for companies that will pack and ship/store belongings by completing their Student Move-Out Plans, as instructed above, or by contacting Residence Life at [residencelife@elon.edu](mailto:residencelife@elon.edu). This service is available directly through the vendors for both off-campus and on-campus residences.

**We will continue to keep you informed about our university coronavirus response through the university website[www.elon.edu/coronavirus](http://www.elon.edu/coronavirus), our regular Monday 2 p.m. community updates, and additional email messages as needed.**
