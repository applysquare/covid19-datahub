Dear members of the Rice community:

Due to the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 situation -- including health risks associated with travel and studying abroad as well as current global travel restrictions and shelter-in-place directives around the world -- we must cancel all undergraduate international programs scheduled before the first day of classes of the fall semester.

This cancellation includes Rice Study Abroad programs, faculty-led programs, CLIC in-country programs, and the travel components of other academic programs (such as those run by the Center for Civic Leadership). We are also not permitting student participation in third-party provider study abroad programs. Questions about the cancellation of summer session undergraduate international travel experiences should be directed to the dean of undergraduates (ugdean@rice.edu).

For graduate students, faculty and staff, restrictions on university-sponsored international travel will remain in place at least through the end of May, and probably beyond that date. We will provide updates as the situation progresses.

We very much understand that this situation is interrupting plans that have been in the works for some time. The reality is that programs and conferences that we would have attended this summer are being canceled. Many who host international travelers arenâ€™t in a position to do that now. At the moment, travel is risky for both travelers and hosts. The world will still be there to explore once the pandemic has passed, and our responsibility now is to not contribute to the spread of the disease.



Please stay safe,

Bridget Gorman, Dean of Undergraduates

Seiichi Matsuda, Interim Provost and Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies
