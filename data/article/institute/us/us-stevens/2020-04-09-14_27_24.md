## Health Advisory & Campus Update

_Updated  April 1, 2020, 4:15 PM_

**To:** Stevens Community  
 **From:** Christophe Pierre, Provost  
 **Date:  ** April 1, 2020   
 **Subject:**   Summer 2020 Semester to Be Held Online 

Due to continued uncertainty about when activity on campus can resume, we are moving all classes for both the Summer I and Summer II sessions online.

Although we remain hopeful that we will all be able to return to campus in the not-so-distant future, we are making this move now to provide a degree of certainty to our students and faculty as they plan their schedules. 

Both summer sessions will take place as scheduled: Summer I classes will start May 19; Summer II classes will begin on July 13. Please consult the [Academic Calendar](https://www.stevens.edu/sites/stevens_edu/files/files/registrar/calendar/2019-2020%20Academic%20Calendar.pdf) for details.

Additional information will be forthcoming. Thank you for being accommodating during this difficult period.

 **Date:**   April 1, 2020   
 **Subject:  **Ways to Support Hoboken First Responders, Medical Professionals, Vulnerable Populations, and Local Restaurants during COVID-19 

Members of the Stevens community interested in supporting those who are on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis in Hoboken as well as those less fortunate members of our community may consider supporting one of the organizations or efforts listed below.  Some options also have the benefit of supporting local restaurants which have also been negatively affected by recent closures.

As always when considering volunteering or making a donation, it is a good idea to review the organizationâ€™s web site, where available.  Some of the recent efforts to provide support have been launched as grassroots efforts by individuals and entities which are not charitable organizations.  The university is not endorsing or prioritizing any organization or individual effort, and we are not providing tax or other advice.  This information is being made available as a courtesy to all who might like to help in this time of need.
