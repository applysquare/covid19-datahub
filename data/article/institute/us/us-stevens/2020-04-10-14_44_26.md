**Information Technology**  
During the current campus closure, all technology support will be provided remotely. If you require technical support, we ask that you search the [Knowledge Base](https://sit.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1865/Portal/kb/) for help. If you cannot find an answer to your question or a solution to your problem in the Knowledge Base, the most expedient method to receive support is to submit a service request through the [IT Service Desk ticketing system](https://sit.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1865/Portal/requests/servicecatalog). This will ensure your request is visible to all User Support Services staff and can be routed to the appropriate person to address your specific issue.

Due to the high volume of people working remotely, we have established a new support hotline to allow User Support Services staff to better assist you. This hotline has enhanced call routing features that will make the process of delivering your call directly to a remote User Support Services staff member more efficient. **The hotline number to call is 201-380-6599.** This hotline will be available throughout the remainder of the current campus closure.

**Office of the Registrar**  
During this week of registration, we will be providing Virtual “Walk-In” Office Hours, during which students will have the chance to speak with a member of our team regarding any questions about registration or other processes.  Our knowledgeable staff will be able to assist you on a first-come, first-serve basis, during the hours of 2-4 pm, Monday, April 6th through Wednesday, April 8th.

Please note that before or after these set times, the best way to get in contact with a staff member is to email us at [registrar@stevens.edu](mailto:registrar@stevens.edu).
