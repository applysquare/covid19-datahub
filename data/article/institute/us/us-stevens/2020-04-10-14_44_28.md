**To:** The Stevens Community  
 **From:** Marybeth Murphy, Vice President for Enrollment Management and Student Affairs  
 **Date:  ** April 3, 2020   
 **Subject:**   Health Advisory: Seventh COVID-19 Case and Guidance on Tuition Refunds 

**COVID-19 Update**  
Stevens was informed today that a seventh member of our community, a student, has tested positive for COVID-19. The student has not visited campus for a number of weeks. As in the prior cases, we will follow Hoboken Health Department protocols. At this time, we have some good news about some of the cases in our community.  Two students and one staff member have recovered and are awaiting clearance from their medical professionals to leave self-isolation. One student and one staff member are improving and recovering at home.  An additional staff member is hospitalized and stable.  We are sending our thoughts and prayers for a quick recovery.

**Tuition Refunds**  
As you know, the coronavirus pandemic prompted a sudden and unanticipated transition to online learning and remote business and student service operations for colleges across the U.S. and the world.  This transition was critical not only to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and the greater Hoboken community, it was mandated by an Executive Order from the Governor of New Jersey, and later, by the President of the United States.  As many students had already made significant progress toward their coursework in the current semester, Stevens, like other institutions across the country, is fulfilling its commitment to students by delivering coursework online and providing ongoing related support services. Since all courses will continue to be offered online through the end of the semester, and students will receive course credit, tuition will not be refunded.

**Additional Resources and Information**  
If you test positive for COVID-19, please immediately contact Stevens Student Health Services at 201-216-5678 or [studenthealthcenter@stevens.edu](mailto:studenthealthcenter@stevens.edu).

For those experiencing anxiety and stress due to the COVID-19 emergency, the N.J. Department of Human Services operates a toll-free “warm line” which is a resource for people seeking mental health service. The warm line is activated during events that impact the mental health of New Jersey residents. The warm line is available 24 hours and has language access: (877) 294-HELP (4357). Note that the “warm line” does not replace 911 and is not used to report emergencies.
