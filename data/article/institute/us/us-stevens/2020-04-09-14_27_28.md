 **Subject:**   Academic Policy Information and Resources 

I would like to express my gratitude to all of our faculty, students, and staff for adapting so quickly to the drastic changes we have been forced to make in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

We are continuing to adjust academic policies and procedures in response to the concerns and experiences of our students and faculty in this new environment.

I would like to direct you to several online resources that can help you keep up with these changes and enable you to connect with staff members who are working remotely.

  * The universityâ€™s [coronavirus web page](https://www.stevens.edu/directory/student-health-services/health-advisory-update/coronavirus-2019-covid-19-information) includes archived announcements about policy changes and FAQs covering various issues.
  * An [FAQ](https://www.stevens.edu/directory/student-health-services/health-advisory-update/coronavirus-2019-covid-19-information/faqs/academics-research-and-classes-faqs) covering assignments, online teaching and learning, and the new grading policy.
  * The [Office of Undergraduate Academics](https://www.stevens.edu/directory/undergraduate-academics/remote-undergraduate-academic-support) is offering remote support, including information about course enrollment and access to tutoring and advising services.
