Dear members of the Tufts community,

The extraordinary challenges we have faced together over the last two weeks have focused us more than ever on the spirit of community at Tufts, which exists whether we are together or apart. We are fortunate to have an uncommonly accomplished, tight-knit and caring community—one whose members support each other in times of need and celebrate each other in times of success.

This is certainly true of those who will graduate from all of our schools this year. By virtue of their hard work, commitment and contributions to our university, they have enriched the Tufts community as students and will continue to do so as alumni. In lecture halls, laboratories, studios, clinics, and hospitals, and through service work in communities close to our campuses and across the world, they have made their mark. This year’s graduates are as vibrant and vital to Tufts as the members of the 163 classes that have preceded them.

In light of the unprecedented public health crisis we are currently facing, we will be unable to bring our graduates together physically to celebrate all that they have accomplished. Though we unfortunately cannot be together in person, we will celebrate the class of 2020 on May 17 with the university’s first virtual Commencement ceremony. We intend to create an inspiring event that draws on beloved traditions, and perhaps starts some new ones.

We are now working to design a unique and participatory virtual experience that will capture the spirit, positivity and fun of a traditional commencement ceremony for graduates, their families, alumni, and the entire Tufts community. We hope you will join us in thinking about how to create an impactful and memorable event. Please follow this link to share your ideas for the ceremony. We are a resilient and imaginative community. I’m confident we will make this a celebration to remember.

Please watch your inbox for additional news as planning progresses and for information about any school-specific Commencement celebrations.

I want to assure all of you that even in this challenging time, the light on the hill still shines brightly.

I sincerely wish good health to you, your families, and your loved ones.

Best wishes,

Tony Monaco
