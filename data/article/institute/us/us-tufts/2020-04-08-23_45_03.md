Dear Tufts admitted students,

I am writing to congratulate you on your admission to Tufts University. We are exceptionally proud of our student body, and we hope you will choose to join our community for the 2020-2021 academic year.

Of course, you are taking this next step in your career in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis, which affects every one of us. While I cannot predict the course and impact of the COVID-19 virus over the next weeks and months, I can say with certainty that Tufts is committed to continuing the education of both its current and prospective students throughout the crisis and offering the highest-quality courses and support you will need to begin your program. I am very hopeful that we will be able to greet you in person, but if you are an international student and unable to enter the country, if you are a student who cannot travel to campus for other reasons, or if the campus needs to be closed to in-person instruction, please be assured that Tufts University, together with all its schools, is committed to providing access to education until the campus can be fully reopened and travel is restored.

Given the unprecedented events we are facing, we will be regularly evaluating circumstances that may require us to make changes, and we will endeavor to provide timely updates to you and the rest of our community. I encourage you to monitor go.tufts.edu.coronavirus for the latest information.

I view our response to COVID-19 as directly related to the mission of the university. Tufts is a world-class institution with a long-standing commitment to engaging with the community, both local and global, in an effort to build a healthier, safer, and more equitable world. Here at Tufts, we fully understand that the crisis brought on by the Coronavirus carries with it an obligation to such a commitment. Tufts President Monaco has taken a leadership role in this engagement, and we are extremely proud of our students who, together with others, have come together to repair more than 6,000 N-95 masks for immediate use by Tufts Medical Center. You can read the full story here: https://now.tufts.edu/articles/team-comes-together-repair-thousands-n-95-masks.

The most important part of our community is our students, and I want to again reassure you that we have already developed the tools and courses we will need to provide you with an exceptional education. Along with my faculty colleagues, our deans, and President Monaco, I am fully dedicated to supporting Tufts’ ability to play a leading role in this challenging time, with our highest priority being the education of our students while further nurturing their own dedication to solving some of the greatest challenges facing today’s world.

If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact the admissions office of the school within Tufts to which you have been accepted. For our international students, the Tufts International Center is committed to supporting you as you prepare to come to Tufts and can answer any questions you may have.

Once again, I want to express my warmest congratulations to you and hope we will see you in the new academic year. In the meantime, I wish you and your loved ones all the best for staying well and healthy.

Sincerely,

Nadine Aubry, Ph.D.

Provost and Senior Vice President
