Dear graduating students,

After reading and hearing your concerns and frustrations with our decision to hold a virtual Commencement, it is clear that we underestimated the importance of an on-campus celebration with your classmates and families. Therefore, we are changing our plans and will hold in-person, on-campus, university-wide Commencement events for all of this yearâ€™s graduates when it is safe to do so.

Our decision to hold a virtual Commencement was based on the obvious health danger of a physical gathering in May. While this still holds true, you have made it clear that a delay is far preferable to moving the event online. I appreciate your feedback and your patience as we navigate uncharted waters during this unprecedented health crisis.

I look forward to seeing you in person on campus for the Commencement ceremonies you deserve.

I hope you and your families and friends stay healthy during the difficult time ahead.

Best wishes,

Tony Monaco
