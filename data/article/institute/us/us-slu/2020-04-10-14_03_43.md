COVID-19: Coronavirus Updates

Updated April 7, 2020

St. Louis Campus

Saint Louis University is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic. The University continues to follow the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as state and local health officials.

Remote Learning and Working

SLU extended remote learning through the end of the spring semester, including final exams, and has transitioned to remote working for all employees not identified as emergency personnel by their leadership.

Exceptions to the suspension of in-person courses and instruction include: the School of Medicine, select programs in the Doisy College of Health Sciences, the Center for Advanced Dental Education, courses that are already online, and off-campus experiential learning opportunities (clinicals, internships, student teaching, etc.).

Health Notices

An employee isolating in emergency operations personnel housing in Grand Forest Apartments has tested positive for COVID-19. Several students and an employee who traveled abroad have tested positive for COVID-19 during the past few weeks. None of the individuals came onto campus after returning the U.S. and all have been isolating at their respective off-campus residences, both in and outside of Missouri.

Consolidated Housing Plan

The University has developed a consolidated housing plan for students who were granted exemptions to live on campus for the remainder of the term. The plan was developed with input from students and public health experts.

Housing Information

Housing for Frontline Health Care Workers and Those Who Need to Isolate

The University is making Reinert Hall available to providers and other staff from SLUCare and SSM Health who don’t feel comfortable doing home. Grand Forest Apartments have been designated for health care workers and other emergency personnel who need to isolate. The Village Apartments have been designed for students living on campus who need to isolate.

See President Pestello’s April 5 update for details

Building Access

All buildings on the University’s north campus have moved to card-access only, making them accessible by card-swipe by those with active SLU IDs. On the south campus, the following buildings are card-access only: Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing building, Education Union, Allied Health building, Dreiling Marshall Hall.

Refunds and Relief for Student Workers

Students who have moved out will receive a 50% refund for both their housing and dining charges for the spring term. Students who commute will receive a refund of any remaining balance left on their dining cards. Students with current parking permits will receive a refund for 50% of the semester parking expense. Student workers are receiving financial relief as well.

Financial Assistance

SLU recognizes that the current public health crisis may bring unexpected financial hardships to students and their families. Resources may be available to help those in need of financial assistance, from emergency loans and grants to the option to appealing financial aid eligibility due to changing financial circumstances. Students facing financial hardships are encouraged to contact the Office of Student Financial Services at sfs@slu.edu.

Grading Policy Changes

In select undergraduate courses for the spring term, students will have the option of choosing from either a “pass/low pass/no pass” grading policy for individual courses, or the standard grading process. We encourage students to consider their grading choices carefully, course by course, to make an informed decision.

Key Academic Decisions

Commencement

SLU has made the difficult decision to postpone May commencement ceremonies and related activities. Students who plan to graduate in May are encouraged to fill out a survey developed in coordination with SGA and other student leaders. Information from the survey will be used to plan next steps. The deadline to complete the survey is Wednesday, April 15.

College Church Mass Livestreaming

We are now live streaming 10:30 a.m. Sunday Masses from St. Francis Xavier College Church. Subscribe to the Church’s new YouTube channel and tune in every Sunday.

Opportunities to Serve

The Center for Service and Community Engagement has compiled a list of the many ways to get involved in the St. Louis community, which will be updated as we learn more from our community partners. You may view the list of opportunities on the CSCE website.

SLU-Madrid

SLU-Madrid shifted to remote teaching on March 16 and will not return to face-to-face teaching during the spring semester. The May commencement ceremony has been postponed, and the campus’ summer session courses will be taught remotely. SLU-Madrid is home to students from across Europe, the U.S. and around the world. While travel restrictions or health advisories may prevent students from traveling to Spain, the campus will be open in the summer and the fall to serve its international student population and advance SLU’s Jesuit mission overseas.

SLUCare

With the health and safety of patients, medical staff and community in mind, SLUCare Physician Group is identifying and rescheduling non-urgent patient appointments. Our medical staff is also identifying patient visits that can be effectively managed through telemedicine, or a virtual visit.
