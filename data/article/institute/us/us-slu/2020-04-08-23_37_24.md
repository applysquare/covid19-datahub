COVID-19 Update March 20

Dear members of the Saint Louis University community,

I write to share updates on two primary concerns of students and their families: refunds and financial relief for student workers.

We know this time of great uncertainty is stressful for our students and their families. Thank you, again, for your continued patience as we work through your questions and concerns. In reviewing how to move forward with refunds, it was important to those involved that students have a seat at the table. I’m grateful to tell you that is exactly what we did, and that – as always – student voices were insightful and heard.

Housing & dining refunds

The following applies to those students who would typically live on campus, but who have since moved out for the remainder of the semester:

Students will receive a 50% refund for both their housing and dining charges for the spring term.



charges for the spring term. Housing scholarship awards will be reduced by 50%.



Between now and March 30, we will work to understand the status of each student (whether they still live off campus or not), with the goal of processing refunds by April 8 .



. At the request of our student leaders, and some of our Billiken parents, we are providing an opportunity to contribute to those most in need. That’s what Billikens do – take care of each other. Thus, students can donate a portion – or all – of their refunds to a designated fund, such as Billiken Bounty, the Student Emergency Relief Fund (for students experiencing unexpected financial needs during this pandemic), or toward SLU’s “Helping Our Own Fund” (emergency funding for SLU faculty and staff). Please email giving@slu.edu and we will set you up with the appropriate person to field your request.



Students can also defer their refund to the next year on a case-by-case basis. To do this, please email sfs@slu.edu.

Those students who have commuted to SLU and relied on campus dining will receive a refund of any remaining balance left on their dining cards.

Parking refunds

Students: All students with current parking permits will receive a refund for 50% of the semester parking expense. For those students who continue living on campus, or those visiting campus, the gates to all University-owned parking lots and garages will be open to accommodate free parking at least through April.

Employees: The University will suspend collection of parking fees from employees for the month of April which will be reflected in your April pay periods. Effective immediately, the gates to all University-owned parking lots and garages will be open at least through April.

For any questions, contact the parking office at parking@slu.edu or 314-977-2957.

Student workers

Students are an essential part of our workforce. As much as we rely on them, we know many student workers rely on the money they earn working on campus.

SLU is committed to compensating employees who can’t continue working on campus during this difficult time. This commitment extends to our student workers.

Per Federal Student Aid guidelines , Federal Work Study (FWS) students who are not able to keep working will continue to be paid for the hours they were expected to work through the remainder of the term.



who are not able to keep working will continue to be paid for the hours they were expected to work through the remainder of the term. Non-FWS student workers who are unable to keep working will receive a one-time $750 grant in the form of a credit to students’ accounts by April 8.



who are unable to keep working will receive a one-time $750 grant in the form of a credit to students’ accounts by April 8. Federal Work Study and non-FWS student workers who continue to work will receive a one-time $750 grant paid as above, in addition to being paid for the hours they work.

will receive a one-time $750 grant paid as above, in addition to being paid for the hours they work. Students who want to keep working should check with their supervisors about whether this is an option. We also will be seeking student workers to be reassigned to staff some essential services. More on that tomorrow.

Those students who wish to donate a portion of their one-time grant to the groups referenced above (Billiken Bounty, or the emergency funds for students and/or faculty and staff) can do so. Please email giving@slu.edu.

Health Insurance

We know many of you also have questions related to the University’s sponsored health insurance for students. More information is forthcoming.

Financial hardship resources

As I noted in my March 18 update, we recognize that the current public health crisis may bring unexpected financial hardships to students and their families. Resources and options may be available, including emergency funding. Families whose financial circumstances have changed should reach out to the Office of Student Financial Services at sfs@slu.edu.

Thank you for your continued, relentless support of Saint Louis University. Please keep monitoring SLU’s COVID-19 website for more information. You can continue to send your COVID-19 questions to pandemic@slu.edu.

Your grace and prayers continue to help us as we navigate difficult decisions during this trying time. Know that you are in our daily prayers.

May God bless each of you and Saint Louis University.
