UConn trustees moved on Wednesday, March 25, to authorize [pro-rated housing and dining cost refunds](https://today.uconn.edu/2020/03/uconn-provide-refunds-unused-housing-dining-plans/) for students who had to leave the university as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The [bursar’s office](https://bursar.uconn.edu/) will calculate each student’s amount and their accounts will be credited. Students who participated in Education Abroad will also be reimbursed based on the nature of their program.
