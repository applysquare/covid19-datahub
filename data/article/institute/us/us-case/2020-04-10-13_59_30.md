To Our Students:

I write today to let you know that we have made the difficult decision to move all summer courses to remote delivery. As much as we want to see you back on campus, it is too soon to predict when that welcome can happen safely. Given the time of year, we wanted to provide clarity now regarding these academic offerings.

In light of this change, we have delayed the opening of undergraduate summer registration until Monday, April 13 (all other summer registration dates remain unchanged). Later next week, we will post updates to course offerings, schedules and other relevant information. I encourage you to take a look; you already know firsthand the talents of our professors, as well as the level of learning you can expect.

That said, if you already have received approval and registered for summer courses elsewhere, prior approvals still will apply (including if the institutions offering them also have transitioned to remote delivery).

With regard to how undergraduates will participate in summer research, we have chosen to wait on this decision until we have more information regarding multiple issues, including the state’s stay-at-home order. Meanwhile, our SOURCE office is asking undergraduates to consider different approaches to how they might manage summer research under different potential contexts—that is, whether they are able to be on-campus full-time, some of the time (i.e. a blend of on-campus and remote efforts), or none of the time (i.e. all remote).

I truly regret that this pandemic continues to disrupt so many aspects of your lives, and commend you for continuing to adapt to them.

With hope that you and your families are well,

Ben Vinson III

Provost and Executive Vice President
