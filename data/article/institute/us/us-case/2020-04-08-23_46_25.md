To Our Faculty, Staff and Students:

The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of activity, adaptation, and anxious anticipation.

You have moved courses online and helped students get home, assisted in making calls and creating new protective gear—and, all the while, watched warily as COVID-19 case projections soared.

You searched for solutions in labs and offered insights to the public. Participated in virtual admission sessions and an online dissertation defense. And you endured more email updates in three weeks than you usually receive in a year.

As much as I would like to express appreciation in person, circumstances make it impossible. For now, please accept this video message.

Barbara R. Snyder

President
