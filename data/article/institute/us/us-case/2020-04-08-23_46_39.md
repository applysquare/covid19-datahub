To Our Students:

We first want to reiterate our deep regret that the COVID-19 outbreak has required that you depart campus well before the end of the semester. We realize this unexpected development not only upended plans and expectations, but also created significant stress for you and your families. We appreciate your patience as we worked to develop and adjust schedules and processes, and hope that you have or will have safe travels home.

Below is guidance for:

Students Who Will be Coming to Campus to Pack All Belongings Before Noon, March 22; Students Who Have Already Packed Belongings and Left Campus; and Students Unable to Return to Campus Prior to Noon, March 22.

Students Who Will be Coming to Campus to Pack All Belongings Before Noon, March 22

All checkouts through noon on Sunday, March 22, will be Express Checkouts, allowing residents to check out at any time, day or night.

Residents of Cutler, Clarke Tower, Hitchcock, Pierce, Norton, Raymond, Sherman, Smith, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Storrs, Taft, Taplin, and Tyler—to complete a checkout, you must:

Remove all belongings from your room;

Clean and return the room to its original condition;

Shut and lock your door; and

Check out through My Housing. See step-by-step instructions on the Housing website.

Note: You should only check out once you have removed ALL of your belongings from your room. Completing the online checkout will turn off card access to the room and building.

Residents of Alumni, Glaser, Howe, Kusch, Michelson, Property Management Apartments, Staley, Tippit, The Village, Triangle Apartments, and all Greek Houses—to complete a checkout, you must:

Remove all belongings from your room;

Clean and return the room to its original condition;

Shut and lock your door;

Retrieve an envelope, available by the Express Checkout box for your Area. Carlton Road: Boxes are on the first floor of each building (in the lobby or next to the office) Murray Hill: Boxes are on the first floor of each building The Village, Property Management Apartments: Boxes are in the Village 3A Office, behind Starbucks and the Village 6 Kitchen Triangle Apartments: Boxes are on the first floor of Tower 2, across from the elevator Greek Houses: Boxes are in Fribley and Wade Commons

On the envelope, please write your name (first and last), network ID, building, and room number;

Seal the envelopes with a piece of tape (rolls provided near the Express Checkout boxes); and

Put the completed envelope into the Express Checkout box.

For all residents checking out, staff will complete the room inventory and check for any damage in your absence. Please note that if your roommate/suitemate has done an Express Checkout, two staff members may enter to check the condition of the space at any time and without notice (they will knock, of course).

Refer to the University Housing website for more information, including storage and shipping options.
