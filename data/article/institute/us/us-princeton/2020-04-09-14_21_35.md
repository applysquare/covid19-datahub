On March 27, University Health Services (UHS) announced a new [Coronavirus (COVID-19) website](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/coronavirus-covid-19) with comprehensive health information and resources for the University community. The website includes testing sites for employees, as well as guidance for if you have tested positive for COVID-19, come into contact with someone else who has tested positive, or have symptoms of COVID-19. Note: The list of testing sites changes often, as sites reach capacity, new sites open up or site-specific testing criteria changes. 

Princeton University continues to operate in compliance with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s March 23 stay at home order. Strictly following social distancing protocols and other health guidelines helps keep those who must remain on campus healthy and safe, including students and essential staff, while doing everything we can to do our part for the larger community.

 **Social distancing** is critical to the success of the University’s efforts to keep the community safe. This includes keeping six feet in between you and other people, at all times, indoors and outdoors.

If you have been tested for COVID-19, in any jurisdiction, please contact UHS at [communityhealth@princeton.edu](mailto:communityhealth@princeton.edu) — you do not need to wait for results to contact UHS, please do so as soon as possible. This will greatly assist contact tracing efforts, where needed.
