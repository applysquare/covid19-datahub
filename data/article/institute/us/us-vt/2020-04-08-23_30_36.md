Dear faculty:

Starting a little more than a week ago, Virginia Tech converted its entire curriculum to online delivery. Approximately 2,400 instructors are now teaching about 4,500 sections via Canvas, Zoom and other distance learning systems. Academic advising and student support programs are also now being delivered electronically, with over 2,700 online appointments scheduled through the Navigate platform last week. The number of students living on campus was reduced from over 10,000 to approximately 800, thus allowing single occupancy accommodation of the remaining students, and student dining services have been limited to pick-up and delivery.

These actions and many more are designed to mitigate the health risk posed by COVID-19 and would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of faculty and staff. While not everything has gone smoothly – for example, some students do not have adequate access to the internet – you nevertheless have enabled Virginia Tech to continue to educate students in the face of adversity.
