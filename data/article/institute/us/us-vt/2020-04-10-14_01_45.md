As Virginia Tech continues “essential operations” and campus safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the university will move summer term academic programs, courses, and lab sections to online delivery. Summer session is an important opportunity for students to continue their academic progress. In transitioning to online summer instruction, colleges and departments are encouraged to work to expand course offerings and opportunities for academic advising and student support services.

In addition to academic programs and instruction, Virginia Tech will move new student orientation sessions, Summer Academy, and all scheduled camps, conferences and events (university or external) to an online format including all 4-H and FFA sessions scheduled to take place on the Virginia Tech campus. At this time, we expect that all summer programs, events or activities that would require a gathering of participants that cannot be moved online would be cancelled.
