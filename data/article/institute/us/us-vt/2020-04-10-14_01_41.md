I am proud of Virginia Tech students, faculty, staff, and the communities that our programs and facilities call home. The spirit of Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) has been shining through since we began to realize in late January that COVID-19 might strike at the heart of what Hokies value â€“ coming together in communities of discovery and engaging with those we serve to solve complex societal problems in every corner of Virginia and around the globe.

While necessary, I understand these changes have had a significant impact on our community. Nowhere is social distancing more apparent than on the Drillfield in Blacksburg, where April is traditionally characterized by gatherings of thousands of Hokies for the Big Event, Relay for Life, and the 3.2-Mile Run in Remembrance. Every day I speak with a student or parent who is adjusting to experiential learning opportunities that have been postponed or a hands-on laboratory or clinical experience that may not be possible. Students who remained in Blacksburg out of necessity have few opportunities for on-campus engagement, while the engagement of students who are staying at their primary residence is completely virtual. This week, we also made the difficult decision to move summer term academic programs, courses, and lab sections, as well as new student orientation sessions, Summer Academy, and all scheduled summer camps, conferences, and events to online delivery.

For our seniors, their hard work and dedication is culminating in a last semester spent off campus and disconnected from the community they formed over the years at Virginia Tech. Graduate students, professional students, and researchers in Blacksburg, Roanoke, and our Agricultural Research and Extension Centers are dealing with the challenges of managing projects, clinical engagement, and research under restricted conditions. Faculty, staff, and students in urban regions of Virginia face the additional burden of operating in a region where the virus is currently more prevalent.

As a continuing student you may be concerned about the experience you will have when you return to campus this fall. As of April 6, we have one confirmed positive case in Blacksburg and a small number of cases in the region. At our other sites, we have small numbers of cases and varying degrees of community spread. We are incredibly fortunate in most of Virginia to have had much more time to prepare for this pandemic than urban centers in some other states and around the world. I am impressed with the seriousness with which our community has taken the guidance to stay at home whenever possible. Yet, we have no illusions that we will escape this round of COVID-19 unscathed, even in Blacksburg, and models suggest that our peak will come in late April or May.
