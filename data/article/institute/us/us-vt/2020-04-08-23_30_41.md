A message from Don Taylor: Research Resources for COVID-19. In effort to keep the research community informed, the Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation has partnered with university leadership and teams across campus to provide guidance, information, and resources in order for researchers, faculty, staff, and students to make the best decisions given various circumstances. As we continue to make plans for a variety of outcomes that will impact the research community that includes faculty, staff, students, and animals, please visit the COVID-19 Updates: Research Continuity Guidance web page that includes a broaderFAQ section in addition to other resources, like the Research Preparation Guidelines, that we hope will provide assistance and guidance as you make plans.

A message from the Global Education Office on study abroad support. The last few weeks have brought unprecedented global developments causing anxiety and concern for many of our students, families, faculty, staff, and partners. We want to take a moment to thank all of you for your understanding. We share in your disappointment over canceled programs, early returns home, and experiences that did not occur. While our focus is still on the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we understand that you may have questions about the future of study abroad programming. Answers to Frequently Asked Questions can be found on the Global Education website. Please also refer to the university’s COVID-19 page for the latest information and announcements.

VPN users should choose ‘VT Traffic over SSL VPN’ setting. When using the Virginia Tech Remote Access Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, users should select ‘connect to VT Traffic over SSL VPN’ whenever possible. This improves internet performance for the user and leaves campus resources available for others who need them. Users should also keep in mind that connecting via VPN is not needed to access Canvas, Zoom, or the email and collaboration tools in Office or G Suite. The university has increased the capacity of the VPN to meet increased demands for the move to online learning for the remainder of the spring semester, however, capacity is not unlimited. The VPN makes it possible for users to access applications that are only available through a Virginia Tech IP address.

Slack licensing fee reduced through June 17, 2020. To aid the university in slowing the spread of COVID-19 and make it easier for employees to stay connected while working remotely, IT Procurement and Licensing Solutions (ITPALS) is reducing licensing fees for the online chat tool Slack to $5.00 for a period of 90 days, effective immediately. The license will allow access to Slack through the annual renewal date of December 19, 2020. With telework now required for Virginia Tech faculty and staff whose jobs can be performed remotely, Slack can be a valuable communication tool, allowing employees to communicate instantly within teams as well as with individuals across the university.

TLOS Top 10: Instructional Continuity Special Edition. The COVID-19 situation has dramatically altered the spring semester at Virginia Tech, and Technology-enhanced Learning and Online Strategies (TLOS) is doing everything they can to support the university's swift transition to online instruction. The coming weeks will be challenging for instructors and students alike, so TLOS has developed this special edition of the “TLOS Top 10” to share tips and gentle reminders that will help faculty adjust to a new model of teaching and interacting with students.

Deadline extended for VT Engage Faculty Fellows program. The VT Engage team has extended the deadline to apply for its Faculty Fellows program to May 15.
