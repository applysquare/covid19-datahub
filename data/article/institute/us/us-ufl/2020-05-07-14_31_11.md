**Graduating with Honors**  
<https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-advising/academichonors/#graduatingwithhonorstext>

  
Every student who was unable to complete laboratory and similar experiments and  
testing for their Honors thesis will be provided the opportunity to complete their work  
in alternate ways as agreed upon by the studentâ€™s faculty advisor and research  
committee.

  
 **Syllabus Policy**  
<http://syllabus.ufl.edu/media/syllabusufledu/syllabi_policy_20191204.pdf>

  
In the shift to an online environment most residential courses faced in Spring 2020,  
faculty had to adjust their syllabi. Faculty have the right to do so as long as students  
are made aware of the changes in advance. All student learning outcomes must  
remain the same. Changes to exam dates and assignment deadlines are discouraged,  
however.

  
All required information as outlined on the UF Syllabus Policy is still required on the  
revised syllabi. One requirement that is not being met is posting the final syllabus on  
a publicly available web site.

  
Faculty should provide students with the revised syllabus and are encouraged to  
review the specific changes that have been made.
