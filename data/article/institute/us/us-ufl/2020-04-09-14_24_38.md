How will the S-U grading affect my financial aid? 
    

The S-U grading will allow the courses to count toward your hours earned for Florida Bright Futures and Federal Aid renewal; however, they do not count towards your GPA.  Further questions are best answered on a case-by-case basis, and, if you are not sure, please submit a case to [sfa-help-@mail.ufl.edu](mailto:sfa-help-@mail.ufl.edu) with specific questions.  Student Financial Affairs staff will then reach out to you to help.
