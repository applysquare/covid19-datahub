**Policy Updates**

This policy revises current [S-U Grading](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/grades-grading-policies/) and [Drop](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/dropping-courses-withdrawals/) Policies by providing students an opportunity to elect, for any or all eligible Spring 2020 undergraduate courses whose last day of class is after March 9, 2020, to remain in letter grading or shift to Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory (S-U) grading.  Spring 2020 courses for which the student earns an S grade will be accepted as meeting requirements for the degree (e.g., for general education, writing, or major requirements.). Please note the following:

  * Neither S nor U grades calculate into the GPA.
  * Students must earn the equivalent of a C grade or better in the course to earn an S.
  * A grade equivalent to a C- or lower will earn a U, which does not earn credit toward the degree.
  * Once a student elects the S-U option, they cannot revert to a letter grade.



 

Students will also be allowed to drop any Spring 2020 course with a W.  No courses dropped in this process will count against the student’s current lower division or upper division drop count.  Students will be fee-liable for courses dropped. Students will not be able to drop all courses in this process and would, rather, follow the [UF Withdrawal Process](https://registrar.ufl.edu/services/withdrawals.html). 

 

  * The window of time in which students can request S-U grading or to drop a course will be **April 1-April 22, 2020**. 
  * The drop/withdrawal deadline has been **shifted from April 10 to April 22, 2020**. 
  * All requests will be made through an online form that will be available on each student’s ONE.UF page **starting April 1, 2020**.
