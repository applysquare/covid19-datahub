Dear University of Miami Community,  
  
As you may know, there’s a new form of internet trolling called “[Zoombombing](http://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3b2688ff48f2b4b701ccfb52712adc13d522a4e9e19823f3711e0f2f973dcf681d7b25c3624aa3ba2af89da02bec54ec7c5f4fb5b3514984 "Zoombombing")”— in which an uninvited participant uses Zoom’s screen-sharing feature to disrupt meetings and classes.  
  
Regardless of whether you are a professor hosting online classes via Zoom, a staff member running Zoom meetings, or a leader of an affiliated group bringing people together via Zoom, **here are some tips to help you keep your Zoom video meetings secure** :  
  
 **Set a meeting password**  
Zoom recently enabled all accounts to automatically require a password when creating a meeting ([click here](http://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3b2688ff48f2b4b7d90d960f523115a3e0f7520531ac8a7bf6a61b700fb6d86d43b87f4bd60f491b49e2b7e4fa2cfa12b80d9ea0447d6ea9 "click here") to learn more about setting or removing passwords).  
  
 **Enable a waiting room**  
The [waiting room](http://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3b2688ff48f2b4b71dd6c7bdb3d06974dfcffb91677357b220d18f849325e1229251156da1b2879b528434681f155eee932f031ebdd320d3 "waiting room") feature allows the host to control when participants join your meeting. As the meeting host, you can admit attendees individually, or hold all attendees in the virtual waiting room and admit all when you are ready to begin.  
  
 **Limit screen sharing**  
Zoom recently updated its screen-sharing settings for all accounts to automatically default to “Only Host.” This setting gives hosts sole permission to share content within their meetings by default. [Click here to learn more about this setting, including how to enable screen sharing when needed](http://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3b2688ff48f2b4b7be4513d1b2d71fb01a1e1864ca7f1a4a696f8d3792951db6ec44401391a09a2cec1d61d08a56f3185c00b3f5a915e221 "Click here to learn more about this setting, including how to enable screen sharing when needed").  
  
 **Ensure you are using the latest version of the Zoom client**  
This will ensure all of the latest privacy and security features are available. Visit [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Where-Do-I-Download-The-Latest-Version-](http://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3b2688ff48f2b4b7a7aed4846820fd3b319fa7e568ccca04011afbe49af63f12cbc1b1d85ceb3b26bd32bdf640364ec50c6f9ccae5c8818b "https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Where-Do-I-Download-The-Latest-Version-")  
  
 **Additional security measures**  
To further enhance safety, University of Miami community members can disable ‘join before host,’ ‘lock the meeting,’ ‘remove a participant,’ and ‘restrict who can join.’

Note that for clinical visits using Zoom, UHealth uses a special version of Zoom which is integrated with UChart, specific for telemedicine encounters. UChart secures these Zoom sessions through advanced encryption, restricts link distribution, and disables the ability to record the sessions. It is highly unlikely that telemedicine sessions will be disrupted by Zoombombing.  
  
If you would like assistance understanding the security settings in Zoom, please contact the UMIT Service Desk at 305-284-6565 or help@miami.edu. If you learn of a meeting where Zoombombing occurred, please contact IT Security at ciso@miami.edu.  
  
As always, feel free to reach out to me directly anytime at erniefernandez@miami.edu.  
  
Thank you,

Ernie Fernandez  
Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer
