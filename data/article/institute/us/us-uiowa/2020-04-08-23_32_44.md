Covid-19 Campus Update for Faculty and Staff

Dear faculty and staff:

Please see these important COVID-19-related updates as they pertain to summer programming, academic deadlines and policy changes, library resources and help, COVID-19 testing, and study abroad.

SUMMER PROGRAMMING

University administrators are currently working with collegiate and department leadership, including shared governance, to determine appropriate next steps for summer programming. Our first priority remains protecting the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the university.

Many of the summer courses provided by the university are already delivered completely online but there are many in-person experiences that occur on the UI campus every summer. The university will provide additional direction by Friday, April 3, 2020.

Study Abroad: Because the U.S. Department of State has issued a Global Level 4 Health Advisory advising all U.S. citizens to avoid international travel, International Programs is canceling all 2020 summer study abroad programming.

POLICIES RELATED TO FACULTY EVALUATION AND TENURE

Teaching observations : Due to the challenges faculty are facing to rapidly move all courses to virtual teaching for the rest of the spring 2020 semester, no teaching observations will be conducted during the spring semester. If teaching observations were performed prior to the move to virtual teaching, these will be included in the annual review.

Post-tenure peer reviews may also be postponed until the fall semester. Probationary and tenure clock extensions: Effective immediately, the university is providing all tenure-track probationary faculty a one-year automatic extension of their tenure clock. The extension will apply to the current probationary period and may lengthen the time to the first probationary review (year three or four, depending on college) or the time to tenure review. The Office of the Provost will enter the extension into Workflow effective May 1, 2020. You may decline the automatic extension, but after declining you will not be able to reinstate the extension. Remember that the tenure expectations remain the same whether an extension has been applied or not. Faculty who are affected by this extension will be contacted individually with more specific information.
