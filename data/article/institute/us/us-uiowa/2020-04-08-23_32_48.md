Please see these important COVID-19–related updates as they pertain to upcoming academic dates, support and services for working remotely, items needed at UI Hospitals & Clinics, support for students, and COVID-19 testing.

What to do if an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19

The University of Iowa has developed guidelines for supervisors in the event an employee becomes symptomatic or tests positive for COVID-19. These guidelines follow Iowa Department of Public Health recommendations and include requiring the employee to remain home for at least seven days after symptoms appear, communicating to other employees within the unit or department, and closing off and cleaning the employee’s workspace. It is important to NOT share the names of or personal information about individuals who have self-identified as having contracted the virus. Supervisors can find resources, including a communication template, on the university’s coronavirus website or by speaking with your human resources representative.

Upcoming Academic Dates

Clarification on end of academic year, expectations for finals week

The date of the academic year remains unchanged. The last day of classes will be May 8 and finals week will be May 11–15. Faculty should communicate their final exam or alternate assessment plans (such as take-home exams, papers, etc.) directly to their students.

Early registration for fall 2020

Early registration for the fall 2020 semester is being moved back by one week to allow more time for students to connect with their advisers. Early registration will now take place April 20 to May 1.

Course withdrawal updates

Undergraduate programs: Individual courses can be dropped with advisor authorization through the last day of classes, May 8. Additionally, complete withdrawals (dropping all classes) for the spring 2020 semester also can be done with adviser authorization through May 8. After that date, students will need to petition for a late drop or late withdrawal and the college dean’s authorization will be required.

Graduate programs: Individual courses can be dropped with adviser authorization through the last day of classes, May 8, and the requirement for dean’s permission is removed. April 14 is the deadline for complete withdrawals for the spring 2020 semester. After April 14, graduate students need the dean’s permission. More information about deadlines and other topics for graduate students can be found at www.grad.uiowa.edu/coronavirus/faqs.

Professional programs: Students in professional programs should consult with the academic offices in their respective colleges for specific guidance.

For more information, see the Office of the Registrar COVID-19 web page.

Support and Services for Working Remotely

Access to offices and classrooms for faculty, staff, and TA instructional efforts

Faculty, staff, and teaching assistants who wish to use a classroom for lecture recording or synchronous distance learning must contact their academic departmental administrator to reserve a classroom to ensure its availability and to make arrangements for cleaning the equipment before beginning and when finished. For more information, email registrar-room-res@uiowa.edu.

Buildings are closed to the public, however those with card access will be able to enter the building. To keep the building clean and safe for all staff, including custodial staff, public spaces within the buildings will be closed. Those entering buildings should do so only to complete a specific activity or task, such as record a lecture or pick up a book, and then leave.

Online support

Information Technology Services (ITS) is ready to help with employee computer-related support. Please use one of the following options:

Click the “Request Help” button on the Keep Teaching at Iowa website

Email the ITS Help Desk at its-helpdesk@uiowa.edu

Conduct an online chat with the ITS Help Desk

Call the ITS Help Desk at 319-384-HELP (4357)

This Working Remotely Guide can be used as a resource.

Drive-Up Wi-Fi

Drive-up wireless service is being offered to allow UI students, faculty, and staff access to high-speed internet without having to enter campus buildings.

The service is currently available at the Hancher South Lot (Lot 55), Hawkeye Commuter Lot (Lots 85 and 39), and the Multi-Tenant Facility and Biomedical Research Support Facility parking lots at Oakdale. It will soon be offered at the Myrtle Avenue Lot (Lot 48) and other locations. Visit the Working Remotely Guide on the ITS website for updates.

Users should join the eduroam network and log in with “[insert your HawkID here]@uiowa.edu” and HawkID password.

Accessibility

The IT Accessibility group is available to assist with any accessibility questions you may encounter during this time of transition. Challenges related to digital accessibility issues place people with disabilities at risk of being underserved or left behind. Accessible technology can mitigate these risks, and enable full participation in academics, employment, and other campus activities. Accessible technologies can benefit a wide range of other users as well. Request an accessibility consultation through the group’s online form, email the UI’s IT Accessibility Coordinator Todd Weissenberger, or visit ITAccessibility.uiowa.edu for more information.

Items Needed at UI Hospitals & Clinics

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, UI Hospitals & Clinics is in critical need of the following items.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) including:

N95 Masks

Isolation/surgeon masks

Face masks with attached eye shield

Full face shields

Isolation gowns

If you are able to donate any of these items, please complete a donation form and bring a copy with your donation.

Monetary donations

The biggest impact can be made through monetary donations to the UI Center for Advancement, which provides support for the hospitals’ most urgent needs.

NOTE: At this time, UIHC and the UI Stead Family Children’s Hospital have temporarily suspended all other in-kind donations.

Support for Students

Student Emergency Fund

The University of Iowa Student Government, Graduate and Professional Student Government, and donors have contributed additional funds for the Student Emergency Fund, which provides microgrants averaging between $50 and $350. Students who experience an event or unforeseen circumstance that negatively and severely impacts their academic success, which may include unexpected medical and travel costs, unexpected decrease in work hours and income, and other unforeseen expenses due to COVID-19, should consider applying with the Office of the Dean of Students. Grants will be awarded based on funds available, which are limited.
