HathiTrust, a partnership of academic and research institutions offering a collection of millions of titles digitized from libraries around the world, has announced an Emergency Temporary Access Service.

The service will allow students, faculty, and staff from eligible member libraries (including Columbia University) to have online reading access to materials that are currently unavailable to them in their library collections.
