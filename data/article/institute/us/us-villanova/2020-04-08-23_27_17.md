March 13, 2020

Dear Members of the Villanova Community,

Governor Tom Wolf has just announced the shutdown of all Pennsylvania K-12 schools for two weeks to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19.) Based upon this new information, and the number of our community members that this will impact, the University will close to the public for the next two weeks and immediately implement additional mitigation measures. As a result:

Students :

All students are required to leave campus by this Sunday, March 15.

Given the short time frame resulting from the Governor’s declaration, and the possibility of a return to campus later this semester, students may leave their items in their residence halls/dorm rooms. If necessary, arrangements will be made at a later date for students to retrieve their belongings.

We are also aware that some international and other students may not be able to leave campus quickly or may need housing during this time. For information about remaining on campus, please visit the FAQ section on our coronavirus website. Additional information regarding student housing may be found on that website under “Student Housing.”

The University will continue with the previous plan of teaching all classes online through Easter break. The University will reassess the situation by Friday, April 3, to decide whether it will be possible to resume in-person classes following Easter break (Tuesday, April 14).

Faculty & Staff :

Faculty and staff must work remotely from home to the best of their abilities starting on Monday, March 16, except for those departments noted below.

While the University will be closed to the public, on-site operations will remain open and the following departments should report to campus unless otherwise notified by their supervisors: Public Safety, Dining Services, Facilities, the Student Health Center and Residence Life.

For additional information, please visit Villanova’s website on the coronavirus, which includes Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and updates as they become available. If you have questions not answered by the website, please contact: (888) 298-1964 between the hours of 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. EDT, Monday through Sunday or email info@villanova.edu.

As a University, we acknowledge that there are still many details to be worked out and many questions that you may have. We are grateful for your patience as we look to provide additional information in the coming days. At the moment, our current focus is on the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff.

The University is dedicated to meeting the needs of our community in what is an extraordinary moment in our history as we face this rapidly evolving public health crisis. I deeply appreciate how many Villanovans—faculty, staff, students, families, alumni and friends—have responded in the Augustinian spirit of partnership and understanding, motivated by the same purpose: to protect the well-being of those in our community.

Sincerely,
