April 6, 2020

Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,

As we continue to manage the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presents, I wanted to provide an update about Villanova’s Summer 2020 semester and other important academic matters.



Summer 2020

All Courses Online for Summer 2020 Semester

In Summer 2020, all courses for undergraduate students and graduate students—including those originally scheduled to be held in person and on campus—will now be offered online. This plan was developed in consultation with the Deans and faculty leadership. Minimum enrollment standards continue to apply for all courses. Students are encouraged to review the Master Schedule and the Summer Sessions website for additional and updated offerings, consult with their academic advisor as needed, and register online via MyNova.

Please note: The Engineering Entrepreneurship Summer Institute and Summer Business Institute will be offered online in Summer 2020.

Dr. Christine Palus, Dean of the College of Professional Studies, will send a follow-up email to all faculty scheduled to teach a summer campus-based course, copying respective department chairs. Information to assist faculty transitioning their in-person courses to online delivery is available here.

On-Campus Research: Summer 2020

University leadership, the Deans and faculty leaders have been working together to develop a plan for on-campus research in Summer 2020. You will soon receive an email from Dr. Amanda Grannas, Associate Vice Provost for Research and Chief Research Officer, to provide an update to our research community once that plan is finalized.

On-Campus Conferences and Camps

The University’s decision about on-campus conferences and camps will be announced after April 14.

Faculty Book Information

Faculty should continue to submit book information to the University Shop for Summer 2020 courses. The University Shop is the source of information for students and also acts as the disseminator of book information across campus departments. It is our goal to have the most accurate information posted online via Novasis and Blackboard for students; submitting your book lists to the University Shop enables this to happen. Falvey Library also works in conjunction with the University Shop to source physical and digital copies of books that are required for courses, and submitting your book list increases the number of titles that are made available for students to borrow. Faculty may email book requests to Rachel Maciag (rmacia01@villanova.edu).

Other Academic Items

FAQs for S/U Grading: Spring 2020

Faculty and students who have questions or are looking for clarity on the University’s enhanced course grading options for Spring 2020 are encouraged to read a comprehensive FAQ now available online. Please note: Grades for courses in Summer 2020 will be issued according to standard grading policies.

Falvey Memorial Library

As classes continue online, I wanted to remind our community that Falvey Memorial Library offers myriad existing and expanded electronic resources and virtual services that support learning, research and academic success. More information about library resources and support during the spring semester can be found on Falvey’s COVID-19 update webpage.

Expert subject librarians are also available virtually to help students and faculty with research. Faculty and students can schedule a consultation, email a question or have a live chat during business hours (Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. EDT).

As information becomes available, we will continue to update the community on important academic matters. I want to thank you for your continued patience and perseverance during this challenging time.

Warm regards, and best wishes for your continued health and safety,



Patrick G. Maggitti, PhD
