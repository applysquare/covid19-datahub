Dear Baylor Students,

Over the past several weeks, you have experienced unique challenges, such as relocating to permanent residences and being separated from family and friends while adapting to new methods of learning. We thank you for your patience during this time as we have made critical and difficult decisions to keep you, faculty, and staff safe.

One of the recent decisions we made was developing a plan to address the financial implications due to COVID-19. We understand that COVID-19 has impacted students and their families in profound ways, including financially.

We are happy to share that the University will provide prorated credits for housing, meal plans, and parking permits and will pay students receiving federal work-study. In certain circumstances, the credits provided may result in a reimbursement, based on certain criteria. Below are the specifics of the plan.

Housing

Students who were not able to remain in the residence halls for the remainder of the semester will receive a credit for their housing room rates, which will be prorated for the dates between March 16 through May 12. Financial Services will process credits for housing by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.

Meal Plans

All meal plans will be prorated March 16 through May 16 by the daily rate associated with the plan. If applicable, any unused Dining Dollars will be rolled over to the next semester. Financial Services will process credits for meal plans by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.

Parking

Students who paid for on-campus parking will receive a $100 credit for their parking passes, which is the standard amount offered for refunds made in March. Financial Services will process parking credits by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.

Payment Due Dates

The University is eliminating late financial settlement fees and registration holds for non-payment for the summer and fall semesters. For students unable to pay the remaining bills for the spring semester, the University will roll these balances to the summer or fall term. Rolled over balances can be included in summer or fall payment plans.

Work-study

For students with federal work-study jobs, Baylor will provide a lump sum payment based on the average number of hours the student worked during the three pay periods before spring break. The amount of a payment will not exceed the student's total federal work-study awarded amount. These payments will be processed through Baylor's Payroll Office by Friday, April 10, 2020.

If a student is not eligible to be paid federal work-study for hours not worked or receives University work-study, we encourage students to seek support by completing the application for the President's Excellence Fund. If you have specific questions about your federal work-study eligibility, please email the financial aid counseling team at financial_aid@baylor.edu.

We recognize the challenges and hardships that many of you are facing. We appreciate your understanding as Baylor transitioned to online course instruction during this unprecedented time. While the course delivery has changed for the last half of the semester due to circumstances beyond Baylor's control, classes are still taking place with the same faculty, and you will receive credit for the classes completed. We have heard positive reports from professors of how well you are adapting to online courses, and we are grateful for your approach to learning and your resiliency, especially during this time.

We look forward to when we can welcome you all back to campus and Waco.

Sincerely,

Baylor University Financial Services
