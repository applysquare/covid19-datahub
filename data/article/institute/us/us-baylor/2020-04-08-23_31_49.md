At 10:00 a.m., the City of Waco put a "shelter in place" order in place through April 7. In response to this order, Armstrong Browning Library, the Institute for Oral History, the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society, the Texas Collection, and the W. R. Poage Legislative Library will remain closed to visitors. Students, faculty and researchers should visit their respective websites for information on how to access research materials.

The Moody Memorial and Jones Libraries are now also closed; however, online resources and support are available at baylor.edu/library. Live chat support is available from 7:30 a.m. - 10 p.m., Monday-Friday. For technical assistance through HelpDesk+ call (254) 710-4357 or email helpdesk@baylor.edu.

UPDATED March 23, 2020

To extend our protections of the most vulnerable in our communities, the Central Libraries have closed the third floor of Moody Memorial Library and the Prichard Quiet Study Commons until further notice. These closures will assist our housekeeping staff and will help us all by reducing the overall footprint of the library. If you need materials from the third floor, visit the service desk on the main floor of Moody Memorial Library and a member of our staff will retrieve it for you. Additional quiet study areas are available on the second floor near the University Writing Center and on the second floor of Jones Library.

We are also asking those returning material to the Central Libraries to use the book return locations (1) outside of the building between Moody and Castellaw and (2) outside of Jones Library.

In addition, checkout equipment pickup has moved from HelpDesk+ on the Garden Level of Moody to the ITS Annex, which is located around the corner from the Baylor Bookstore in the Fifth Street Parking Garage.

While the Central Libraries are open to support students and faculty, social distancing practices will be enforced throughout the facility. As noted previously, cleaning materials are available at service desks in the Central Libraries so that you can clean keyboard and mice on public computers before using them.

The Baylor Libraries are here to support students, faculty, staff and researchers during this transition to a new teaching and learning environment amidst the unparalleled circumstances presented by the onset of COVID-19.

Central Libraries Restrict Access

After careful consideration, the Libraries will enforce restricted access to Moody Memorial Library and Jesse H. Jones Library beginning Wednesday, March 18. Patrons will be required to swipe their Baylor ID card to gain access to the building during hours of operation.

While the Libraries will be open, we encourage those who come onto campus to follow the advice of the CDC and reduce social contact. Our housekeeping staff is increasing its efforts to sanitize our facilities, cleaning supplies are available at service points throughout the Libraries to clean computer keyboards, mice and other contact surfaces.

The safety of our patrons is of utmost concern. If you have questions, please email us at libraryquestions@baylor.edu. or call (254) 710-2122.

Special Collections Open to Appointments Only

W. R. Poage Legislative Library, The Texas Collection, the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society, and the Institute for Oral History, will be accessible by appointment only.

Armstrong Browning Library Available by Appointment Only

In order to inhibit the potential spread of the coronavirus, the Armstrong Browning Library is joining other local museums and attractions by closing its doors to visitors until further notice. Individual researchers and students can still access the collection by appointment by calling (254) 710-4968 or sending a request to abl_office@baylor.edu.

A number of the holdings of the Armstrong Browning Library can be discovered online through the Baylor Libraries Digital Collections. In addition, the Libraries have prepared an online resource guide, Keep Learning, to help you access library assistance and resources remotely.

Additional Information

As noted in emails from the President and Provost, the new Keep Teaching and Keep Working pages highlight online resources to support faculty making the transition to online teaching and learning. In addition, the Libraries developed a resource to support students, faculty and other researchers who need to access library assistance and resources remotely: baylor.edu/library/keeplearning.
