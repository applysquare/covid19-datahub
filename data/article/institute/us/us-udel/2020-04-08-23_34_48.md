Editor's note: President Dennis Assanis and Provost Robin Morgan sent this message to the University of Delaware's undergraduate students on March 26.

Dear Students,

As the world navigates challenge and change in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, one thing remains constant: our commitment to your success. We know this is not a typical spring semester at the University of Delaware, and we already miss seeing you here on our campus and in our classrooms. Many of you may feel anxious about your academic progress, or disappointed by the prospect of distance learning as an alternative to the interactive campus experience we have all come to know and love at UD. We hear you, and we understand. That is why we formed a dedicated University committee to evaluate opportunities to maximize your success and recommend a plan forward for academic progress.

As a result, we have decided to provide some greater flexibility to facilitate adaptiveness and productivity for the Spring 2020 semester only, and we are committed to help you achieve your goals and finish strong. This means we are implementing some fundamental changes in the delivery of our academic programs that include modification of our grading policy as well as an extension of the period during which students may withdraw from courses without academic penalty. You will find a more detailed explanation of the emergency policies we are putting into place for this semester, effective immediately, at this link.

We can assure you that the entire University administration is focused on doing everything possible to sustain academic continuity with a focus on the long view, advancing students toward the finish line with fairness and flexibility. To this end, the Provost’s Office will work closely with the colleges, the Registrar’s Office and Student Financial Services to make this progress possible.

Student success is not something we just support at UD; it is what defines our mission. During this time of transition, we remain committed to carry that mission forward, and we believe in you and all that you will accomplish in the coming months. Above all, please remember to take care of yourselves, with health and safety as the number one priority.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we all work together through the current circumstances, and we wish you the best of luck for a great semester ahead!

Sincerely,

Dennis Assanis

President

Robin Morgan
