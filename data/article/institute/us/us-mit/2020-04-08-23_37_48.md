K-12 summer programming update

During the summer months, MIT ordinarily hosts many K-12 programs both on and off campus. In light of current public health guidance, and in an effort to provide these programs and their potential participants with sufficient time to plan, we have made the following decision:

MIT will not host or sponsor any in-person K-12 student programming during the summer of 2020. This includes:

on-campus programs operated by MIT

on-campus programs run by external vendors who rent space from MIT

off-campus programs that send MIT students, staff, and faculty into local, national, and global communities to work with K-12 students

Remote programming is allowed and encouraged: summer programs that wish to move to an online format should begin planning to do so as soon as possible.

This guidance does not apply to programs working exclusively with adults in the K-12 sector (e.g., teacher training and professional development), although future guidance and restrictions on adult programming may be forthcoming.
