April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

April 7, 2020 2:41 PM College Weekly - 04/06/2020 Emory College Students Hey there, Welcome to April! We've made it into our third week of remote teaching, and spring has definitely sprung. We hope that you, and your loved ones are well. In the College Weekly today, we're going to cover what you need to know for the week ahead, information on walk-in advising and academic success resources. We've also got part 2 of "Cool Courses." Read on for more... S/U Grading Basis Last week we announced that we have extended the deadline for you to choose between the letter grade or S/U grading basis for this semester. The new deadline is April 27. After this date you will be able to petition to change the grading basis. All of the details can be found in the email we sent you, or by clicking here. Advising Walk-In Hours In addition to our regular advising appointments, our advising team is offering virtual walk-in hours until the end of semester. The schedule and Zoom links can be found on the College Connect Home Page EPASS Academic Success Programs Want to finish the semester strong and stay connected to other students? Join EPASS for a Remote Learning virtual coaching group. In this collaborative group, you’ll share ideas with a small group of your peers, create weekly action plans, and learn success strategies to help you finish strong this semester. The Remote Learning coaching group meets Thursdays, 5:00-6:00pm EST via Zoom. Register through College Connect to join! Looking for ways to improve your time management, reduce your academic stress, and successfully navigate the remote learning environment? Check out these helpful handouts and self-coaching tools from the EPASS office! Honor Council Reminder The Emory College Honor Council would like to remind students that while you are completing coursework remotely, the Honor Code is still in effect. Be cautious as you interact and collaborate with others, or when you discuss or share your own work or the work of others. Please take a moment to review the Emory College Honor Code’s Appendix 3: Academic Misconduct in the Remote Learning Environment. Be mindful as you navigate remote teaching and learning as the new normal for the remainder of the semester. Most importantly, if you are in doubt about whether your actions may be problematic, you should contact your professor directly for clarification. Pre-Registration Pre-Registration continues this week for Emory College students. This week, students with 45+ earned hours will enroll. Please note that earned hours only includes courses that you have already completed. Hours that you are currently enrolled in this semester are NOT included in this count. In preparation for pre-registration we encourage you to: Review your enrollment times in OPUS Schedule an advising appointment with your major or pre-major faculty advisor. If you are not sure who your advisor is, their name and email address can be found in OPUS. Visit the University Course Atlas to explore courses for the Fall 2020 semester With pre-registration underway, here is part 2 of our Cool Courses feature. This feature is designed to highlight interesting opportunities, open to Emory College students, for credit. These are courses which typically have no pre-requisites. BUS 499: Design Thinking Do you want to learn a powerful approach for developing practical, creative solutions to real-world, messy, wicked problems? At its core, design thinking uses the mindset and methods of design practitioners to identify and address human needs by developing functional and emotionally meaningful products, services, processes, and spaces that address those needs. This highly experiential course, taught by Prof Jan Barton, is open to all Emory students, regardless of degree or major. Through short lectures and guided teamwork, you will learn a design thinking framework and a set of tools to help you navigate ambiguity, improve your ability to empathize with others, integrate diverse preferences and points of view, reframe challenges, ideate creative solutions, develop a “just-try-it” mindset for rapid experimentation, and enhance your presentation skills with storytelling and graphic design elements. You will showcase your learning in a final project addressing one of Emory’s current strategic challenges. REL 200R: LGBTQ Religion & Spirituality Rather than asking what religious traditions say about sexuality and gender, this course will focus on what LGBTQ-identified people have had to say about religion and spirituality, exploring their cultural agency and creativity. Here are a few examples of topics we will explore: the identification of the assassinated gay activist and politician, Harvey Milk, as "Saint Harvey Milk" by some LGBTQ people; lesbian feminist embodied goddess spirituality; the Radical Faeries movement; the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence order of "queer nuns"; the spiritual dimensions of Native American "Two-Spirit" identities; LGBTQ-affirming expressions of Pentecostal Christianity; LGBTQ atheism. The course will include site-visits, participant observation in cultural events, and guest speakers representing a variety of groups and communities.

April 6, 2020 10:54 AM Emory’s Commitment to Belonging Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Emory University’s motto — the wise heart seeks knowledge — underscores one of our key institutional principles: Our work here is driven by the heart. Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

April 3, 2020 4:30 PM Preventing Zoombombing Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Some Emory community members have reported incidents of “Zoombombing” where uninvited guests crash their Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars, and sometimes share upsetting or offensive content using the screen share option. Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.

In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.

In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.

While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.

The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.

April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option. We want to share more information on how these changes will affect Emory College students specifically. Changes to S/U Grading Option We will extend the current S/U change deadline until April 27 (the last day of class for this semester).

the current S/U change deadline until (the last day of class for this semester). After April 27, students will have the option to submit a petition to request a change from a letter grade to S/U basis. Petition information will available on the Committee on Academic Standards website no later than April 24, 2020. Students must submit their petition for consideration by the following deadline: Graduating Seniors – May 11 All other students – May 18

Spring 2020 Study Abroad students who are considering changes to the grading basis of their courses must contact their Study Abroad Advisor in order to make any changes. They cannot make changes in OPUS. Other Academic Options There have been no other changes to the academic options available to you. Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10

Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3

Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu

Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education

March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A. Tedesco, Ph.D. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs – Graduate Studies Dean, James T. Laney School of Graduate Studies Professor, Rollins School of Public Health Emory University

March 30, 2020 10:03 AM Emory’s Commitment to Health and Safety Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared with community members while protecting patient privacy. As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

If you are having chest pain, serious difficulty breathing or any other type of medical emergency, call 911.

If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean’s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the Office of Injury Management (OIM) can help assess an employee’s readiness to return to work.

If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms. Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside. Social distancing is defined as remaining out of group settings, avoiding gatherings, and maintaining a 6 feet distance from others when possible per the CDC guidelines. Emory takes the health of our faculty, students, and staff very seriously and we are doing everything within our power to keep our community safe. Please continue to go to the university’s COVID-19 website for the latest updates and resources.

March 28, 2020 9:57 AM Welcoming Oxford to Atlanta Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Today, we welcome Oxford College students to Emory’s Atlanta campus to form a new community of more than 300 scholars actively engaging in remote learning while continuing to observe social distancing. To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S.

March 27, 2020 2:57 PM Emory Expands Support Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Throughout the unfolding challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve been proud of the many ways that Emory employees have rallied to support one another, working together as we adapt to a fast-changing landscape. From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

March 24, 2020 4:08 PM Parent and Family Update Emory College Students Dear Parent and Family Members,



I wanted to reach out to you today to provide some updates that have been sent out to your student in the past week. Before providing some updates, I want to include a video Michael Elliott, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences filmed to communicate directly with you. If you are unable to view the video by clicking the image above, please view the video on youtube. Remote Teaching We began remote teaching this week. Your student will likely have attended their first online session. Our faculty are working hard to make this a great experience for your student. If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance. Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon. As always, my team is available to answer any questions or concerns that you might have. You can reach them by emailing oue.advising@emory.edu Sincerely, Joanne Brzinski, Ph.D.

March 24, 2020 9:56 AM Emory Moves Forward Together Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, Together, we’ve now experienced our first day of campus-wide remote learning, the new normal for university students across the nation. That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare

March 23, 2020 1:09 PM LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis Graduate Students LGS Community, We write to follow up on the message from the Interim Provost Leadership Team to provide a process for requesting a change of grading basis from letter grade to S/U. We provide this added flexibility in recognition of the change to remote education, and your need to manage this in the context of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. You can change the grading basis of one, some, or all of your courses, and you will have several weeks to make your decision. We encourage you to discuss this with your advisor, especially if you are considering this change for a required course. How to make a request: You can make requests now through April 10.

Use this form: LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. You will need to log in to the form using your Emory credentials.

LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. To help us process requests in a timely and accurate manner, follow the steps below to identify the classes that should be changed: Log in to your OPUS account, click “Course Planning and Enrollment,” and then “View My Classes.” That screen will have the information you need to provide in the form: (1) course subject and number, and (2) class and section number.

March 23, 2020 8:56 AM Emory Together, We Transition Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To help students remain focused on their educational goals, this week Emory University formally launches the EmoryTogether Fund — a $5 million fund designed to support our undergraduate, graduate and professional students facing financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

March 21, 2020 9:13 AM Emory’s Transition to Remote Learning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community: On Monday, March 23, life at Emory University will begin to look different. The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity & Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes & Noble

Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the Dining website for updated hours and availability.

Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus, boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the Dining website. Parking and Transportation Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential. This change in parking policy is provided to support social distancing during the COVID-19 campus operating environment. Email any parking questions to parking@emory.edu. Email shuttle or commute questions to commute@emory.edu. Peavine I and II Decks; located at 29 Eagle Row

Oxford Dining Hall for boxed meals: 8 a.m.-10 a.m./11 a.m.-3 p.m./5 p.m.-8 m. International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux

Associate Dean for Academic Affairs

Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com.

March 19, 2020 6:49 PM Emory financial support and updates to grading options Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, Emory is here to support our students. As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare

March 18, 2020 3:01 PM Spring 2020 Commencement Update Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear members of the Emory community, Commencement is a beloved tradition in our academic community and a singularly important moment for our graduating students and their families. It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk

March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research & Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.

March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways.

March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

March 16, 2020 3:00 PM Emory College COVID-19 Update Emory College Students Emory College COVID-19 Update - March 16, 2020 We know that you have many questions about how the transition to remote teaching will work for the remainder of the semester. We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.



Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.

If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management & Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.

Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.

Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.

Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.

Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can. Technology Access If you do not have access to a computer or are concerned about regular internet access in your home location, please also reach out to OUE directly at oue.advising@emory.edu. Textbook Rentals The bookstore has announced that the textbook rental due date has been extended to May 23, 2020. They will also work with students who return rentals after this date to ensure that you not penalized in any way. Barnes and Noble does provide a free shipping label from UPS if students choose to return their rentals by mail. You will need your order number to print the shipping label which can found on your confirmation email or rental reminder emails. Domestic Students: The label can only be printed ONCE so all books must be shipped back together. Click here to obtain the label.

We are working to provide you with updated information as it becomes available. We will keep you informed of any developments as it relates to your academic endeavors. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with your academic questions and concerns at oue.advising@emory.edu.



Best wishes,

March 15, 2020 8:50 PM The Week Ahead Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, As we enter our last week on campus together before beginning a new phase of remote learning, it’s critical to acknowledge the resilience, support and courage we’ve already seen demonstrated by students, faculty and staff throughout this challenging transition. Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.

In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare

March 14, 2020 9:30 PM Two Emory Undergraduates Tested for Possible COVID-19 Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear Emory Community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared immediately with community members while protecting patient privacy. With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

March 14, 2020 4:20 PM Confronting the COVID-19 challenge Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff To our students, faculty and staff, At the end of what has been a difficult week, we want to reach out to express our appreciation and admiration for the entire Emory community. We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

March 14, 2020 11:45 AM Laney Graduate School – PDS Suspension Graduate Students Dear LGS Students, Due to the conditions surrounding responses to COVID-19, including concerns related to travel and social distancing, we are temporarily suspending the LGS Professional Development Support Funds (PDS) application portal, and we are not accepting PDS applications until further notice. Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.

March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.

March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19. Emory University is taking steps to limit the spread of the virus. Students are expected to move out of Emory residential facilities by Sunday, March 22, at 5 PM. This was a difficult decision for the University, but the overall health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and surrounding community is our priority. We understand that this news impacts each of you in different ways, and we will be here to support you over the coming days. As you prepare for the upcoming transition and begin packing your belongings, we will ensure you have supplies. We will provide moving bins, trash bags and other moving supplies, as well as information about storage options. You will receive more details in the coming days about these resources and move-out procedures. We will consider limited exceptions to allow certain students to remain on campus and provide support for those students who may need assistance with packing. We will review these requests as soon as possible on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions may include: Students who will have difficulty returning to their home country based on governmental travel restrictions due to COVID-19.

Students with demonstrated financial hardship or who are housing insecure.

Students who are unable to return to Atlanta to pack their belongings All students must complete the Move Out/Stay Request Form by Monday, March 16 at 5:00 p.m. Students who are permitted to stay on campus will be required to relocate to a different residential space. Services will be limited, including access to many facilities, recreation and dining. We know how disappointing it is for you to receive this notification and the disruption it will cause to our community. With the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizing the importance of taking active measures to contain spread of the virus in communities and mitigate risk to vulnerable populations in their communities, we believe it is the best decision at this time. While the residence
