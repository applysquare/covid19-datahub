This message was sent from Wake Forest Undergraduate Admissions

Based on guidance from community-health officials for preventative measures against the global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), beginning Friday, March 13, and until further notice, Wake Forest University Admissions is suspending all campus visits, student-led tours, and admissions programming, including our “A Day in the Forest,” Campus Day, and MOSAIC events.

Please know how much we wish we could see you in person. Until then, we hope you’ll take the time to explore our website (admissions.wfu.edu) and social media accounts (@wfuadmissions on Twitter and Instagram) to stay connected with Wake Forest. You may also receive updates about COVID-19 and changes on campus at wakefo.rest/coronavirus.

This was a difficult decision for us to make and we understand how disappointing it may be to you, but we hope you’ll take solace in knowing how thoughtfully and seriously we value your wellbeing and that of our campus community.

Please know we’ll be back in touch soon.

All our best,

Wake Forest University Undergraduate Admissions
