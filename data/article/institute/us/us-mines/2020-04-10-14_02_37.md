Office of Research and Tech Transfer: Updated guidance for on-campus research

The following message was sent to all Mines faculty and graduate students on 4/2/20:

Dear all,

As we approach our one-week anniversary of conducting research under stay-at-home rules, I wanted to give you a better sense of how we are planning for different possible scenarios for the future. I realize the uncertainty is high and the stress even higher; I wish we had more definitive answers, but hope that walking through a few examples may help you as you look ahead.

Scenario 1: Stay-at-home order continues as is for an extended period of time (at least through April 30 is very likely across the country; other states have put orders in place through early June):

Under this scenario, we expect to allow more students and faculty to access research facilities over time. We are currently prioritizing time critical needs (e.g., immovable deadlines, or experiments that will fail without in-person care) and student deadlines as much as possible. We are also prioritizing research with a high home-to-campus ratio, where a small amount of work on campus enables a significant amount of work at home. We realize that requests that we had to turn down initially because they appeared less urgent will become urgent over time, and we are committed to re-evaluating all requests on a regular basis (initially 2 weeks, but on a more rapid cycle if we remain in this state for an extended period of time). As you submit your requests, consider when the go/no go date is where you must have access to campus or miss a critical deadline for fieldwork, or thesis submission. Your Deans and I are committed to getting you a final answer within 72 hours as long as we can get all the information we need, and we have been under 24 hours for most of you this past week.

Scenario 2: A stricter stay-at-home order of unknown duration prevents all campus access:

Should a complete lock down be ordered, with all research labs shuttered, we will work with you and help wherever possible to make sure you have the resources to do what research you can (and are comfortable with). We will also pull together on-line training opportunities, help facilitate remote seminars and collaborative discussions, and support proposal writing for anyone feeling so inspired. And, we will keep you updated on guidance from sponsors that impacts your funded research. Every indication from federal sponsors is that no-cost extensions on grants will be readily granted, along with significant flexibility for charging to grants regardless of research productivity. Having said that, there is no expectation of additional funding for any ongoing projects, so all deliverables would still need to be met with the same budget even if the timeline is more generous.

Scenario 3: A more rapid release of restrictions than anticipated:

Even when the global pandemic finally ebbs, no one is expecting a sudden return to normal activities and access. But as restrictions are lifted, regardless of when, we will increase access to research facilities as safely and quickly as possible , again using urgency of deadlines and impact of lost access for prioritizing who gets back to campus first.

I know many of you are preparing contingency plans to address variations of the above scenarios. If you are questioning your assumptions or would like feedback on how your plan might work in the context of everyone elseâ€™s plans, feel free to reach out to me or anyone in the Research and Tech Transfer Office.

As challenging as this time of uncertainty may be, I believe that we that will get through it and emerge stronger. It is my privilege to support the incredible research that you do, and the good that so much of it will eventually do for the world. In the meantime, thank you for your patience and perseverance.
