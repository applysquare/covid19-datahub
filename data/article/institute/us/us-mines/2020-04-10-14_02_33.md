From the President’s Office: Remote Work Operations Extended to April 26, 2020

The following message was sent to Mines faculty, staff and graduate students on 4/8/20:

Dear Colleagues,

As many of you are aware, Governor Polis has signed an Executive Order extending Colorado’s stay at home order until April 26, 2020. Consistent with this order, Colorado School of Mines is extending its remote work operations until April 26, 2020.

All employees who are not identified as providing critical services are expected to remain off campus and work remotely. Essential employees will continue supporting the small number of students who remain on-campus, the faculty, staff and students who are maintaining critical research, and the systems and services critical to the remote learning of our students. The process for assessing critical research activities will continue as described on the Mines research website.

As a reminder, the state-wide stay at home order requires all Colorado residents to stay in their homes or residences as much as possible, with only limited exceptions. We urge all Mines community members to heed the directives of public health officials. In the coming weeks, please stay home as much as possible, avoid gatherings of any size, consolidate grocery shopping trips, and practice proper social distancing and wear face coverings whenever you do leave your home.

Thank you for all you are doing to help our community during these challenging and unprecedented times. Together we are making a difference.
