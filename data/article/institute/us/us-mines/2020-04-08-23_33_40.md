From the Registrar: Process Changes for Fall/Summer 2020 Registration

The following message was sent to campus on 3/27/20:

Dear Friends,

As you know, registration begins on March 30th for the summer and fall semester. We wanted to let you know that we have made some changes that will hopefully ease the registration process.

The Registration Action Form (also known as blue slips) is now available on Trailhead.

Students will complete the online form and it will email it to the departmental approver.

The departmental approver will do a few things to complete the transaction.

One, if additional approval is needed i.e. instructor permission, the department will need to reach out to the instructor and obtain consent. Two, once consent is received, the departmental approver will need to enter the override into Banner. Three, follow the link in the email and select SUBMIT (approval forms may have more then one class listed, only approve your classes!) The approval in the workflow will notify the student so that they know that they have received permission and may then log in to Trailhead and register themselves.



Until further notice the Office of the Registrar will accept all forms electronically.

Requests should come from the student. The approver (faculty or department) will need to simply forward the email with the form attached along with the words, “I approve” in the body of the email and then send to registrar@mines.edu. (Forms with approval must be sent from a mines email account.) Forms can be found here: https://www.mines.edu/registrar/forms/

Some of the forms are still pdfs and we are working on getting them converted to e-forms as fast as we can.
