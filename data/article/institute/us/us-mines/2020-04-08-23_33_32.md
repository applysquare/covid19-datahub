From the Provost: Pass/No-Pass Grade Option and Extended Withdrawal Deadline for Spring 2020

The following message was sent to Mines faculty, students and staff on 3/29/20:

Dear Mines Community,

As we move to remote learning for the rest of this semester, our students have expressed concern and uncertainty as to how they will perform in their courses. The uncertainty is natural, and likely shared by some faculty, too, given that we have not emphasized this learning approach before. This is not a concern unique to Mines students, and has been a topic of discussion at the state level and between universities in Colorado.

In recognition of this concern and after consideration of input from students, faculty and the state, Mines is offering its undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to choose a pass/no-pass (P/NP) grade option for any or all of the classes they are taking this semester, or to withdraw from any class by the final day of classes, Wednesday, April 29, 2020.

Here are the key elements of the changes:

All undergraduate and graduate students in every degree program may opt for a P/NP grade in any or all classes.

“P” grades shall represent a letter grade of “C-” or higher, in accordance with statewide guidance from the Colorado Department of Higher Education. “NP” grades shall represent a letter grade of D+ or lower.

Grades of “P” will be accepted to satisfy degree requirements. Grades of “P” or “NP” will not count as part of your grade point average (GPA).

Students must opt-in to P/NP for each of their courses individually. If students do not indicate they want P/NP, they will still receive grades on the normal letter scale. Students will be allowed to choose P/NP for one or more classes and take grades for the rest.

The deadline for students to declare a P/NP grade option or withdraw from a course is the last day of classes, Wednesday, April 29 by 5 p.m. MST . There will be no late requests for P/NP, nor can a student change their selection after this deadline.

. Instructors will not be informed that students have chosen the P/NP option for a class. At the end of the semester, the instructor will submit letter grades for all students as normal. The letter grade will then be converted to “P” or “NP” by the Registrar’s Office for students who have chosen the P/NP option.

Students are strongly encouraged to discuss the P/NP grading option with their academic advisors, who will help guide students considering the P/NP or withdrawal option. Students may also request assistance via the Center for Academic Services and Advising (CASA) at www.mines.edu/casa. Varsity athletes should speak with Dixie Cirillo at dcirillo@mines.edu prior to deciding as the P/NP option may impact NCAA eligibility.

Before making any decisions, students should also understand the impact, if any, to continuation of their financial aid. Mines’ Office of Financial Aid is prepared to help students with that determination.

A notation and/or attachment will be included on all student transcripts explaining the temporary policy change, to help ensure P/NP grades do not disadvantage students with graduate schools or employers.

Thank you for your patience. Understandably, we wanted to share the news as soon as possible to give our students ample time to make the right decisions for them. To further aid in those deliberations, the Registrar will be adding details on the P/NP option to www.mines.edu/registrar in the days ahead.

Stay well and remember: You are not alone. At Mines, we climb together.
