March 14, 2020

Dear Students,

The University has made several difficult decisions in the past week in the interest of our communityâ€™s health and well-being. Included in these decisions was a notice to all students to immediately practice low-density medical standard social distancing.

This included a clear mandate to cease all student group activities, on or off campus. No parties. No events.

Do not jeopardize your health or that of your fellow classmates. Any failure to follow medical precautions exposes our police and medical first responders to unnecessary risk that can flood the emergency response system in the middle of a global health crisis.

To that end, any student, student organization, or group of students found to be congregating on campus, or off campus, will face immediate intervention by Penn Police. Students and organizations violating this directive may face additional consequences, including referrals to the Office of Student Conduct.

This is an unprecedented situation, for our campus and the world. Please join us in ensuring that the health and safety of this community remains our top priority. Do not risk your health or your academic standing with poor decision making at this critical time.

Wendell Pritchett, Provost

Valarie Swain-Cade McCoullum, Vice Provost for University Life
