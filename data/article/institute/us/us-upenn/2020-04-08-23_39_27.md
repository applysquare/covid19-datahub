To all Penn Undergraduates:

March 20, 2020 - We are enormously grateful for your patience and understanding during the events of the past few weeks. None of us expected – or wanted – the disruptions to this semester. We are now excited to return on Monday to teaching and learning, our most important work together as a Penn community.

Along these lines, we are now writing with an update about grading options for the rest of this semester. We have decided that all undergraduate students, across the four undergraduate Schools, may choose to designate any course pass/fail for the Spring 2020 term – including courses satisfying your major or general education requirements. You may take as many of your Spring 2020 courses pass/fail as you choose, and you will have until the end of the day on April 13 to decide whether to take any course on a pass/fail basis. You must “opt in” to this expanded pass/fail option, and any courses taken on a pass/fail basis during Spring 2020 do not count against the total number of courses you may take pass/fail according to the policy of your School.

We are confident that, next week, our great Penn faculty and students will continue the outstanding academic experience of this semester. At the same time, we know that many of you have concerns about the shift to remote learning and the stresses of this unexpected global situation. That is why we are offering all students the option to choose how to handle your grades this semester. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plan with your academic advisor in the weeks ahead.

Thanks to all of you as we together navigate these unprecedented changes. We are determined to continue our most profound mission of education at Penn, and we will continue to keep you informed as the semester moves forward.
