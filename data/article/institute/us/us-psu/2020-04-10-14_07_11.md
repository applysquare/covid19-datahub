UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. – Penn State Law in University Park will have a mandatory credit/no-credit grading system for the spring 2020 semester in order to be supportive of students during the novel coronavirus public health crisis.

“Ultimately, the faculty decided to move forward with a form of mandatory credit/no credit out of concern for the students most impacted by COVID-19,” said Dean Hari Osofsky. “This approach prevents students facing severe challenges from being additionally comparatively disadvantaged and from having to make hard choices about whether to opt in or out in a semester where they simply could not perform as well as usual.”

The new grading policy was developed through an extensive student input process and national benchmarking of other law schools. Students participated through a Student Bar Association survey, an Information and Listening session with the dean and members of the law school’s response team, their representatives at the faculty and curriculum committee meetings, and individual emails. This mandatory credit/no credit approach is also the one most widely taken by law schools around the country.

Penn State Law is providing extensive guidance to students about the spring 2020 grading policy through its memo on grading changes and FAQs. The Career Services Office is also working individually with students and employers and holding information sessions for students to help them navigate this challenging time.
