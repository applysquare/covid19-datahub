Colleagues,

I am writing in my role as chair of ITAC. ITAC met yesterday to review all planned summer programs. Given the current conditions with the COVID -19 pandemic, we have made the following decisions:

Lehigh is suspending all Lehigh-led summer abroad programs that are scheduled to begin prior to August 1. We will be communicating this to students later this afternoon. Programs that begin after August 1 are not suspended, but will be reviewed again before May 13. If the US State Department has not lowered the worldwide global health travel advisory from a level 4 (Do not travel),ITAC will suspend the program. If the travel advisory has been lowered, program directors may continue to make plans; however, the worldwide global health advisory must be at a level 2 by the time of travel in order for the program to continue. Program directors will be required to submit amended ITAC documents indicating planning with regard to the continued COVID-19 risks, including financial. A member of ITAC will follow up with additional guidance.

Please do not hesitate to follow up with questions. This is an extraordinary time, and we are seeking to make the best decisions with regard to the health and safety or our community. Sincerely, Cheryl Matherly Dr. Cheryl Matherly Vice President/Vice Provost, International Affairs Lehigh University Coxe Hall, 3rd floor 32 Sayre Drive Bethlehem, PA 18015 Tel: 1-610-758-2981 cam716@lehigh.edu global.lehigh.edu
