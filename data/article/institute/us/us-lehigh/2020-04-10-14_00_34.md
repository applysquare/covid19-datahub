Dear Campus Community,

As the COVID-19 health crisis unfolds, it has become clear that the disruption to the Lehigh Valley will continue into the summer months. Lehigh’s first day of summer courses—Summer Session I courses and Summer Session full-term courses—is Tuesday, May 19.

As you are already aware, we have postponed Commencement, originally scheduled for this similar timeframe, and Reunion, which was scheduled for June. In the same vein, following the advice of our health professionals and CDC guidance, we can reasonably expect that social distancing will continue to be recommended for at least a good part of the summer session.

For this reason, we have decided that all Lehigh courses offered during the summer of 2020 will be delivered via remote instruction. Making this decision now will allow for more certainty and planning as we all prepare for the summer. We encourage faculty and instructional staff to seek assistance as needed when planning summer courses. The Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning has helped many instructors transition to remote teaching this semester and has been helping faculty develop online summer courses for many years. Look for upcoming communications from the CITL with information, resources, and support plans for instructors moving forward.

We know this semester has been challenging for students, faculty and staff, and that the summer session might present similar challenges. We appreciate your continued enthusiasm and effort, which serve as a constant reminder of what makes Lehigh great. Thank you for all that you do.
