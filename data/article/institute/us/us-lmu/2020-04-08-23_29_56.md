LMU continues to monitor the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and is working diligently to safeguard the safety and well-being of our community. Please visit LMU’s Coronavirus Website (Accessible; En Español) for the latest information.

Credits or Refunds for Students

In support of our students and families, the university will offer prorated credits or refunds for housing and parking for the remainder of the semester. We are also working with our dining services partner to offer partial credits or refunds. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we determine appropriate ways to calculate and process adjustments. Additional details are forthcoming.

Student Employment Update

The university has decided to suspend all student employment to facilitate social distancing and community well-being. Undergraduate and graduate student employees are not to report to their on-campus employer for the remainder of the spring semester. Student Employment Services (SES) shares the following important updates below. To read the full update, visit the SES website. For specific questions and consultation, contact SES at ses@lmu.edu.

March 27, 2020 Payment – All undergraduate and graduate student employees will be paid on March 27, 2020. Student employees must have an active Student Employment Authorization (SEA) to receive this paycheck and will be paid regardless of their SEA award balance. This paycheck will be a duplicate of the March 13, 2020, paycheck, which reflects hours worked February 23 – March 7, 2020.

Additional Payment - After the March 27, 2020, paycheck, student employees with SEA balances will receive a lump sum payment on April 8, 2020 to absolve their remaining earnings. The lump sum payment will be calculated using the March 13 paycheck hours, multiplied by four (the number of pay periods remaining in the semester). However, the lump sum payment will not exceed the SEA award amount.

Paycheck Distribution for Student Employees – Checks will be deposited for those authorized with direct deposit service. Paper checks can be picked up between 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Payroll Office, University Hall 1880. The last physical distribution of paychecks will be March 27, 2020.

If you believe there are major discrepancies in your hours worked February 23 – March 7, or if your SEA balance is negative or low, consult with your supervisor immediately.

Distribution Center Update

The Campus Business Center will close beginning Monday, March 23. Campus residents who need to pick up mail after this date should contact the Distribution Center directly at dchd@lmu.edu to schedule mail retrieval or arrange for mail forwarding.

The Distribution Center is currently looking into options for re-shipping FedEx and UPS packages to alternate addresses. If a solution is identified, instructions will be posted on the Distribution Center's website.

Distribution Center Special Weekend Operating Hours - The Distribution Center will be open this weekend with limited staffing to facilitate student package pick-up. During these special hours, package retrieval will be the only service offered. Hours will be:

Saturday, March 21 and Sunday, March 22 from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m.
