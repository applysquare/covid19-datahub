The Division of Student Affairs realizes that this is a very challenging time for all students. Please know that we will do our best to support you during this time. We encourage everyone in our community to support one another, practice patience and grace, and find it within yourself to be flexible and understanding. Please read the following important information.

Student Housing

Please read this communication carefully for details about student housing for the remainder of this semester.

All student housing residents must move out by Sunday, March 22, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. Students with very extenuating circumstances must petition to remain in university housing.

Petitions to remain will be reviewed by the Dean of Students office and granted on an individual basis. Residents petitioning to remain in student housing must submit requests by 5:00 PM on Tuesday, March 17. To complete the Petition Form please go to: MyLMU-->Campus Life-->Student Housing Online Services-->Student Housing Online Services-->Application Forms.

Residents approved to continue living in university housing for the remainder of the semester will be housed in university apartments, one per bedroom to facilitate appropriate social distancing. Student Housing will transition approved students to their assignments once units are cleaned and available. Residents approved to remain will be charged their current rate, regardless of their new assignment.

Move Out Procedures

Student Housing has simplified the resident move-out process for ease and efficiency. The steps required to move out of your residence are listed below. Each of these steps must be completed to officially move out of your residence. Please note: You will NOT need to visit an Area Office as part of the move out process.

Step 1. Select your Move-out Date & Timeslot

Move-out will take place from Saturday, March 14 through Sunday, March 22 at 1:00 p.m.

A specific number of timeslots will be available each day to prevent large groups of residents from moving out at the same time.

Residents must select a move-out date and timeslot by 5:00 PM on Tuesday, March 17 . Please complete this form to select a move out date and timeslot.

Step 2. Clear your Residence

Ensure all of your belongings are removed from your residence.

Microfridges

If you have rented a Microfridge, you may leave it in your room. Collegiate Concepts will pick up Microfridges after all residents have moved out.

Storage Options

LMU is aware of the following vendors to assist with packing, storage and moving.

Come 2 U Storage: Offers packing for you (even if you are not present)*, storage & shipping

Campus Storage: Offers packing for you (even if you are not present)*, storage & shipping.

College Boxes: Offers packing for you (even if you are not present)*, storage & shipping.

Dorm Box: Offers Storage pod service and shipping.

Dorm Room Movers: services include moving (if you are present), no packing of boxes, storage & shipping.

* If students use a vendor who will pack for them, they NEED to fill out a "Retrieval Of Belongings" form available on their Housing portal as well as create an account with the relevant company.

Step 3. Fill out the Express Check-out Form

The Express Check-out Form is available on your Housing portal.

Once you have completed this form, Student Housing will remotely shut off access to your assignment.

You do NOT need to visit an area office to swipe/check out.

NOTE: If you cannot move out by March 22, you must complete the Short-Term Move-out Extension Form.

Short term move-out extensions will be granted on a case-by-case basis. Requests for short-term move-out extensions must be submitted by 5:00 PM on Tuesday, March 17. To request a short-term extension, please go to: MyLMU-->Campus Life-->Student Housing Online Services-->Student Housing Online Services-->Application Forms.

If you have specific questions, please call the Student Housing Office at 310-338-2963 or send an email to housing@lmu.edu.

Student Employment

The university has decided to suspend all student employment to facilitate social distancing and community well-being. Undergraduate and graduate student employees are not to report to their on-campus employer for the remainder of the spring semester. Remote work is NOT permitted. Students will be automatically paid for their regularly scheduled hours at their authorized pay rate. Pay checks will be distributed on scheduled pay dates already determined by the LMU Payroll calendar. Student employees will be paid either until their current Student Employment Authorization (SEA) award amount is exhausted or at the authorized SEA end date, whichever comes first.

For specific questions, please contact Student Employment Services at (310) 338-7606.

Student Psychological Services

Student Psychological Services (SPS) remains committed to supporting student well-being and resilience. Due to the campus transition to online course delivery, as well as recommendations from the CDC to promote social distancing, SPS is implementing the following temporary service changes. These changes will be in effect from Monday, March 16 until the end of the semester.

SPS will provide mental health services to new and existing clients by video or phone only.

For students interested in initiating services, please call SPS and leave a message for the front desk who can assist you in your scheduling needs. We will return your call by the next business day.

Existing clients, receiving psychotherapy and psychiatry, will be contacted by their provider regarding scheduled appointments.

All psychotherapy groups and workshops are canceled for the remainder of the semester.

Rapid Response services remain available by phone. Please call SPS and follow the prompt for urgent concerns, or leave a message to speak with a therapist the next day.

After business hours and on weekends and holidays call SPS at 310.338.2868 and follow the prompt to speak with the after-hours therapist.

In a life-threatening situation, call 911.

Please contact SPS at 310.338.2868 with any questions about services offered for the remainder of the semester.

Office for International Students and Scholars

The Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS) shares the following information below for international students during the period of online instruction.

Student Visa Status

OISS continues to monitor and follow all current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State guidance for our F-1 and J-1 students and exchange visitors. Based on guidance received from DHS’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), we can confirm that student visa status will not be impacted by the emergency transition to distance learning for normally in-person classes. International Students can temporarily engage in distance-learning, either from within the U.S. or outside the country. However, please be advised that your F-1 visa regulations still apply, and international students must continue to make normal progress in a full course of study as required by federal regulations.

Students Graduating in May Wishing to Apply for OPT

Current federal regulations require that you must be physically present in the U.S. at the time you apply for OPT. You can leave the U.S. while the application is pending. Your application must provide a mailing address in the U.S., where USCIS can send any correspondence related to your application. It is essential that this address be valid for three to five months and that the person receiving the mail must be at that address to receive the mail and forward it to you.

Online Courses

Faculty are being encouraged to provide asynchronous methods of learning to accommodate students in different time zones. If your courses remain at the regularly scheduled time, please contact your professor for advice on how you can navigate this successfully. The Keep Learning Website serves as our student portal for accessing technology support resources and guidance for online learning.

Housing

International students should return home if they choose to, or remain in Los Angeles in their off-campus residences. We understand that some students living on-campus will not be able to return to their home countries. Students in this situation may petition for an exception to remain on campus and these requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Residents petitioning to remain in student housing must submit requests by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17. To complete the Petition Form, please go to: MyLMU-->Campus Life-->Student Housing Online Services-->Student Housing Online Services-->Application Forms. Student Housing will continue to provide further details here. Any questions regarding the move, gathering your items, or other housing-related issues can be directed to housing@lmu.edu.

OISS staff will continue to produce visa documents, respond to emails, and be available via email and Zoom. We will continue to send out updates and provide the most up-to-date information on our website. During this time, it is essential that you read any emails you receive from the university and OISS. As always, for any visa related questions, please email viasupport@lmu.edu.

Campus Recreation and Student Facilities

Burns Recreation Center, The Lion’s Den Coffee Shop and The Loft will be closed until further notice. For more information and updates, visit the Campus Recreation and Student Facilities website.

Student Code of Conduct

The safety and security of our students, faculty, and staff is a top priority. Therefore, the Student Conduct Code remains in effect for all students for the remainder of the spring semester. LMU will continue to investigate and adjudicate any behavior in violation of the Student Conduct Code, including on-line behavior. Those found responsible for violations of the Student Conduct Code may be immediately removed from student housing and subject to additional sanctions. All conduct matters will be addressed promptly.

If you receive communication from the Department of Public Safety or the Office of Student Conduct & Community Responsibility, you must respond and make yourself available for a telephonic investigative interview and, if appropriate, a telephonic or on-line conduct hearing.
