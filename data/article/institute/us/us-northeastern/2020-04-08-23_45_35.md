To all members of the Northeastern community:

Experience is at the core of what it means to be a Northeastern student and, ultimately, a Northeastern graduate.

And for graduates and their families, no experience is more singular than joining together as a community on the first Friday in May to celebrate all they have accomplished—and all they are prepared to achieve.

Among the most invaluable capacities we gain from experience is that of adapting ourselves to the unknowns of a dynamic world, while maintaining the values of our shared humanity.

In this spirit, we will adapt this year’s celebration of commencement to the necessities of this unprecedented moment of global challenge—preserving what we all need today more vitally than ever: a deep sense of community.

While we cannot be together in person this year, we will mark Northeastern’s 118th Commencement in every way open to us, beyond a single day or event.

We will begin by convening our 2020 graduates for an interactive virtual ceremony on May 1. Consistent with the university’s rich tradition, we will feature an inspiring address from a pioneering individual who has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge, possibility, and achievement. And we also plan to offer new opportunities for interconnecting the Northeastern family in ways that further enrich this virtual event.

We will also extend our celebration by scheduling special gatherings for our graduates and their families in communities around the world, when we are once again able to meet face-to-face, hand-to-hand. These celebrations will of course acknowledge our law school graduates, newly minted PhDs, and CPS grads.

In the weeks ahead, we will provide the proud members of the Class of 2020 and their families with more information about our ongoing plans to hail their memorable moment of accomplishment—and new beginnings.

Let us remember that Northeastern is about experience without boundaries. As such, honoring the impact of our community is not bounded by time or place. As this graduation year, 2020, marches on—we will celebrate the remarkable achievements of Northeastern graduates, past and present, every day.

Sincerely,

Joseph E. Aoun

President
