To all members of the Indiana University community,

I write to share the enormously disappointing news that IU must postpone all Spring Commencement Ceremonies on all campuses that are scheduled in May. Current guidance from the CDC, restrictions on large gatherings, and our own focus on health and safety make it impossible to hold these cherished traditional events as scheduled. I am taking this action now so you can adjust any commencement travel plans given the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commencement is a seminal moment for our graduates and their families, and today’s announcement is truly only a postponement of the moment that has been so richly earned. All IU graduates will be able to participate in a future IU Commencement Ceremony when the public health situation again allows us to do so.

All IU degrees will continue to be awarded when earned, and this change of plans in no way affects the timing and awarding of IU degrees.

I know that our students are working incredibly hard to reach this milestone, and those who earn an IU degree deserve to be celebrated with their friends, professors, families and loved ones. We are especially saddened to have to postpone this year’s ceremonies, as these students will be the Bicentennial Graduating Class and the first in IU’s third century.

As I have previously announced, IU is working vigilantly to adapt to the evolving COVID-19 situation. We have put in place a means for virtual classes and other measures so that students can complete their courses this semester. Even as we find the disruptions to our personal lives and the work of the university so all-encompassing, I am deeply grateful for all that our faculty, staff and especially our students are doing as we all work through this grave health crisis together.

Once again, there will be additional communications as we learn more. Please continue to check our website for all updates and additional information at coronavirus.iu.edu.
