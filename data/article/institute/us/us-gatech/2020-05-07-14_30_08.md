UPDATED April 13, 2020: As communicated previously, Tech’s summer semester will remain completely online, with the intention of resuming normal operations for the fall semester. For residents who need to remain on campus after May 1, we’d ask that you submit an appeal to live in Georgia Tech Housing for the summer semester, via the email you received. On-campus services will continue to be limited during the summer semester, and while we will do everything possible to allow residents to remain in their current rooms, there is a possibility that we will ask you to further consolidate rooms so that we may complete necessary summer maintenance and facility repair projects. We know that moving some residents to a third room in less than two months is not ideal, and we will work to avoid this scenario as best as possible.
