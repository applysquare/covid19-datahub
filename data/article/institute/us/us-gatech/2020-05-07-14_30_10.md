UPDATED April 16, 2020: Georgia Tech Spring Commencement will not take place May 1 and 2, 2020. Georgia Tech will recognize its Spring 2020 graduates with an online celebration on Friday, May 1, and an in-person ceremony on campus later this year.

The uncertain evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to set a specific date for the in-person ceremony. The target time frame is the end of the summer semester. Should that not be possible, the end of fall semester will be considered for the in-person ceremony. There will be as much notice as possible given so you can make plans to attend at that time. 

Additional information is available [on the Commencement FAQ](http://commencement.gatech.edu/Spring2020FAQ).
