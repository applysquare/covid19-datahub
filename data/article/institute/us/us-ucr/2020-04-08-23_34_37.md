Dear Campus Community:

The Riverside County Public Health Officer has issued a revised public health order, extending the physical closure of the UC Riverside campus for all but the most critical university functions. The closure was originally scheduled to end on April 3, and has now been extended to April 30.

The university will continue with its transition to remote instruction for the entire spring quarter.

Please continue to monitor UCRâ€™s COVID-19 website, email, and social media channels for additional updates.

Thank you for your continued hard work, patience, and flexibility during this extraordinary time.

Stay Healthy,

Kim A. Wilcox,

Chancellor
