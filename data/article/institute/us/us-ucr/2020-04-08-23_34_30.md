Dear UCR Student,



As we continue to navigate the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges each of you might be feeling at this time, UCR will be implementing additional changes to the spring 2020 late payment penalties and additional fees. Please read the following carefully: $100 Late Payment Fee will not be assessed to any student for spring 2020.

Students utilizing the Deferred Payment Plan (DPP) will not be charged a late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).

will not be charged a late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter). Students with non-tuition and housing charges (i.e. parking, library, etc.) will not be charged the Student Business Services late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).

for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter). Students in housing will not be charged a housing payment late fee for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter).

for March, April, or May (spring 2020 quarter). Students in housing will not be charged the spring 2020 housing activity fee .

. New registration holds for delinquent accounts will not be placed until April 16, 2020. Students with outstanding charges for the Spring 2020 quarter only will be able to make registration adjustments for spring 2020 through the end of drop/add via self-service. Delinquent Holds for outstanding charges from a previous quarter will remain in place.

Students with outstanding charges for the Spring 2020 quarter only will be able to make registration adjustments for spring 2020 through the end of drop/add via self-service. Delinquent Holds for outstanding charges from a previous quarter will remain in place. Course material fees will be adjusted for courses that, in this new learning environment, do not require the equipment or other educational resources traditionally covered by the fee. Of the approximately 280 course material fees typically assessed, 8 courses will retain these fees because the educational resources will still be provided to support the student-learning experience. Please allow the first week of instruction for these adjustments to be made to your student account. The Registrar’s website will be updated to reflect which course material fees remain in effect for spring. All changes are in effect for spring 2020 only.



For guidance on tuition and fees beyond those listed above, please reference the communication released March 25, 2020, to all students.





If you find you are in a position that you cannot continue attendance for spring 2020, please ensure to follow standard graduate and undergraduate cancellation and withdrawal procedures, which can be found on the respective websites:
