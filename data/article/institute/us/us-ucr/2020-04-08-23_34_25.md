Dear Highlanders,

As many of you know, registration for UCR Summer Sessions begins on April 1. Normally UCR hosts around 600 in-person classes during multiple sessions that run from June to September, helping to make our campus a vibrant place to be in summer.

This year, campuses like ours are facing the risk and uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 crisis â€“ including the possibility that we will be unable to return to in-person instruction for summer. With registration now upon us, and being aware of the advanced planning that both faculty and students must make to participate in summer session classes, UCR and other UC campuses must decide now whether to continue remote instruction into summer.

After consulting with campus leadership, including the Chair and Vice Chair of the Academic Senate, and checking in with colleagues at other UC campuses, we have decided to continue remote instruction through summer 2020.

Making this decision now will enable students to register for classes with the knowledge they need to make related plans for summer, including residential and employment decisions, and will give faculty substantial lead time to plan for remote instruction. We believe this is the best way to support our students after spring quarter, especially those whose progress to degree may be affected by their ability to access summer courses.

Summer Sessions will be working with the academic departments during the next week to update the summer schedule of classes to accommodate remote instruction.
