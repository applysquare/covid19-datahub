UC Davis Campus Coronavirus Information UC Davis is committed to the safety and well-being of our community. The campus is working closely with the local public health department and the University of California Office of the President. We continue to implement measures to protect our community.

The Latest

Updated 1:50 p.m. April 7 — When Chancellor Gary S. May suspended campus operations March 18, he advised that, “generally, employees should assume they will work from home through April 7, unless they hear otherwise from their managers.” Since he made his announcement, the state issued a stay-at-home order without an end date, and Yolo County extended its shelter-in-place order to May 1. Therefore, UC Davis’ current guidance to employees (except those who are designated): Expect to work remotely until hearing otherwise you’re your managers.

UC eases admissions requirements

Updated 11:45 a.m. April 1 — The University of California is implementing temporary measures to relax undergraduate admissions requirements for students looking to enroll at UC for fall 2020 and future years as applicable.

The short-term measures include:

Suspending the letter grade requirement for A-G courses completed in winter/spring/summer 2020 for all students, including UC’s most recently admitted freshmen. Suspending the standardized test requirement for students applying for fall 2021 freshman admission.

Providing that there will be no rescission of student admissions offers that result from students or schools missing official final transcript deadlines, and student retention of admission status through the first day of class until official documents are received by campuses.

For transfer students, temporarily suspending the cap on the number of transferable units with “pass/no pass” grading applied toward the minimum 60 semester/90 quarter units required for junior standing.

Unitrans: Weekend Service

Updated 8:45 a.m. March 18 — Unitrans, the ASUCD-city bus service, today moved to Weekend Service, under which buses operate only on the G, K, M, P, Q, O and V-MU lines, starting at 7 a.m. This will continue until at least March 27.

Service levels for spring quarter are being reviewed.

How to report positive tests

Updated 6 a.m. March 18 — Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter said we need to plan for the eventuality of a member of our campus community testing positive for COVID-19. "The campus has an obligation to review, verify, and report when this happens," he wrote in a letter to the campus community.

He shared the protocol and contact points for individuals reporting their own positive test of COVID-19, as well as one for an immediate family member or colleague.

Information line

Updated 6 p.m. March 17 — While the latest, most detailed information about coronavirus and the UC Davis campus can be found online, the university has also established the campus Coronavirus Information Line, 800-809-6097, for people who wish to speak with someone on the phone. The line is staffed with operators who can answer very general questions about classes, housing, events, health, admissions, incoming students, employee concerns and travel.

Campus grows quiet

Updated 4:30 p.m. March 17 — Online finals Day 2 is underway. Remote instruction is the general order for spring quarter. Many of us are working from home. Students are moving out. Campus leaders earlier this week lowered the attendance cap for events to 50 and are now urging no gatherings at all. Meanwhile, the university is working closely with Yolo County public health authorities on next steps to keep people apart.

The Office of Research provided guidance strongly recommending that on-campus research activities be adjusted and reduced where possible to minimize the spread and possible impact of the coronavirus.

The UC Office of the President has authorized up to 16 days of paid coronavirus-related administrative leave for employees who need to stay home to care for their children (amid school closures) or who become sick with the disease or need to care for family members who have it.

Leave for academic appointees

Updated 4:30 p.m. March 17 — Academic Affairs has updated its guidance on COVID-19-related leave for academic appointees, aligning the guidance with UC President Janet Napolitano’s March 16 executive order authorizing up to 128 hours — or 16 days — of leave for eligible employees.

Study Abroad suspended

Updated 1:20 p.m. March 16 — UC Davis has suspended all international and U.S.-based Study Abroad programs through summer, taking in Spring Seminars Abroad, Spring Quarter Abroad, Summer Abroad and Summer Abroad Internships.

“The safety and well-being of students is our first priority,” officials said in an announcement on the Global Learning Hub website.

Officials said students will receive full refunds of all fees and deposits. Messages are being sent to students in all of these programs with further details, next steps to take and how the Global Learning Hub within Global Affairs will support students during this transition, including but not limited to providing advising on alternative plans and providing assistance in returning to the United States.

“While we recognize the disruption this causes for students, families, and institutional partners, we hope the timing of this decision was prioritized to give students time to plan for other opportunities, with the support of the Global Learning Hub, Undergraduate Education and other campus offices, such as enrolling in on-campus courses, pursuing online or alternative global learning opportunities, and making other arrangements to ensure continued progress toward degree.

The UC Education Abroad Program also is adjusting its programming. Look for information here.

Attendance cap now 50

Updated 8:30 p.m. March 15 — Acting on updated guidance issued today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UC Davis officials lowered the university’s attendance cap for events to 50.

The cap applies to all events, university-sponsored or otherwise, in all campus spaces and venues, at all UC Davis locations, and to university events held off-campus.

“Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities,” according to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, which recommends an attendance cap of 50 for eight weeks.

UC Davis had been operating with an attendance cap of 150, to remain in effect through spring quarter. This led to the cancellation of Picnic Day and Decision UC Davis for newly admitted freshmen and their families, among other events. The Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts has canceled all events through March 31.

The CDC further advised: “Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene and social distancing. When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.”

Remote instruction in spring

Updated 3 p.m. March 14 — Undergraduate lectures and discussion sections will be offered through remote means all spring quarter, campus leaders announced today. In another new directive, they said the university’s event attendance cap of 150 people will be extended through the end of spring quarter — which means Picnic Day is among the casualties. Still, the campus remains open and students can stay. UC Davis’ comprehensive educational and personal support services will be available in both in-person (small groups with social distancing) and remote formats.

The letter focuses on instruction, including graduate education and training, but notes the campus’s efforts “to help all members of our community find ways to adapt to our current situation.” Human Resources has prepared guidance for supervisors and managers on workplace concerns, such as employees who become sick or need to care for loved ones, and a telework page that allows managers to make decisions concerning remote work arrangements.

And, for employees and students with young children who are impacted by the recent K-12 school closures, “please know we will do our best to be flexible and understanding during these most unprecedented times.”

“Working together as a community, in accordance with our Principles of Community, we will continue to adapt to these challenging times,” the letter states.

Yolo has 2nd positive test

Updated 7 p.m. March 13 — The Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency announced it has received confirmation that a second county resident has tested positive for COVID-19. The individual is an adult over 60 years old and acquired the infection through travel, according to a news release.

Avoid international travel

Updated 11 a.m. March 13 — UC Davis travelers must avoid all nonessential international travel, to any country, under revised guidelines posted by Global Affairs to its coronavirus travel advisory page. In addition, the guidelines strongly advise against UC Davis affiliates’ personal travel outside of the United States.

The guidelines also advise against nonessential university-sponsored domestic travel, particularly by air, encouraging people to find alternate means of conducting business, such as video or web conferencing; and caution faculty, staff and students to consider a variety of factors including travel restrictions, university policies, registration and approvals for high-risk locations, and their own health risks before making plans for personal domestic travel, particularly by air.

Global Affairs also issued this reminder: If you are traveling internationally on university business, you must register your trip, which provides real-time updates and additional protections. UC Davis travelers may also choose to register personal trips.

The Global Affairs update also includes President Donald Trump’s order, taking effect at midnight today and lasting for at least 30 days, suspending the entry into the United States of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States, and including this caveat: “This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.”

Global Affairs has updated its coronavirus question-and-answer page with additional information related to international and domestic travel plans, travel insurance, reimbursement, and spring break travel.

Athletics competition suspended

Updated 3:30 p.m. March 12 — Intercollegiate Athletics announced it will suspend winter and spring competition indefinitely, effective immediately, because of the coronavirus outbreak. Officials made the decision in conjunction with a similar announcement by the Big West Conference (most UC Davis sports are members of the Big West). In a news release, Intercollegiate Athletics said: “This decision was made in the interest of the health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches and staff, administrators and fans.” Intercollegiate Athletics had earlier limited attendance at competitions to essential personnel and a student-athlete pass list, and the conference had canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.

Spring commencements

Updated 1 p.m. March 12 to clarify which events are subject to the university-mandated 150-person cap on attendance.

Research continuity and planning

Updated 10:30 a.m. March 11 — The Office of Research has posted a webpage on research continuity and planning for COVID-19. “With the ongoing concern about the spread of this disease, laboratories and research facilities should begin to plan for the possibility of a significant disruption to routine operations,” the webpage states. “Each laboratory or research facility is best positioned to create a continuity plan that will meet their unique needs. This guidance is provided to facilitate the development of your plan.”

New campus directives

Updated 4 p.m. March 10 — Campus leaders issue new directives for next week’s final exams (they cannot be in-person), paid leave for people who have COVID-19 illness or are caring for family members with COVID-19 illness, and limiting the size of gatherings to no more than 150 people, from Thursday, March 12, through March 31 (this limit does not apply to instruction through the end of this week, or to Intercollegiate Athletics or the Mondavi center for the Performing Arts). Plus, a new caution against nonessential travel, domestic or international (beyond the international prohibitions already in place).

Reject xenophobia

Updated 10 a.m. Feb. 28 — University leaders are urging members of the campus community to take an active role in rejecting xenophobia, bigotry and racism associated with COVID-19.

“If you are in a situation where you see or experience xenophobic activity or any level of disrespect, racism or bigotry, we ask you to be active not passive,” said a joint statement by Renetta Garrison Tull, vice chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Emily Galindo, interim vice chancellor for Student Affairs. “Stand with your fellow colleague, student or peer to de-escalate the incident.”

Hendry Ton, associate vice chancellor for Health Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, said in an earlier statement that health care providers must be aware that physical ailments don’t happen in a vacuum, and are affected by a patient’s social and economic circumstances.

“The lesson here is that to truly address illness and suffering, we must equally address the biological roots and the social ones,” he said.

Yolo County info page

Updated 4 p.m. Feb. 1 — Yolo County, in which the Davis campus is located, has added a resource and information page about the coronavirus. It includes how the county is responding to the situation as well as information about the virus, its symptoms, preventions tips and other resources. The county indicates that as of Jan. 31, it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus.

Fight it like the flu

Updated 5 p.m. Jan. 31 — UC Davis continues to think locally and globally regarding the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and is spreading around the world.

INFLUENZA Protecting yourself against the flu is protecting yourself from “a real and present danger right now here at home,” UC Davis Health’s chief nursing and patient services officer, Toby Marsh, said in a memo to all staff late this afternoon (Jan. 31). “An estimated 15 million people have been infected by the flu this season, with more than 8,000 deaths so far. In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.”

The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus — the flu.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, “person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.”

On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a “very high threat” travel destination for university affiliates.

Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County’s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident — a man — had tested positive for the novel — or new — coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.

The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.

More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.

Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.

Travel advisory

With today’s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates’ China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China — and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.

Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.

Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs’ COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.

Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs.

The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.

The best defense

To help protect against flu virus — and by extension, coronavirus — Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.

UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.

Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: “Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.”

Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. “This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,” Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.

Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.

Schorzman’s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.

Human-to-human transmission

Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”

He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.

“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.

“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”

Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”

He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.

“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”
