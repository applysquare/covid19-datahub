We hope you and your families are well. Please read on for important updates from the EEE team that pertain to remote teaching and educational continuity.

Remote Teaching Resources

Some of the most common topics we get questions about are:

UCI’s Teach Anywhere site contains UCI’s latest campus educational technology news and support resources for your remote teaching needs. This is a living and evolving resource, so we invite you to provide feedback on what additional information we should post to help you with remote instruction.

Remote Learning Resources for Your Students

As students also adjust to remote instruction, you can help set them up for success by sharing the Learn Anywhere website with them. Consider adding the link to your syllabus, or sharing it in your Canvas course space.

Faculty and TA Support for Canvas Now 24/7

Instructure (the maker of Canvas) will now handle all faculty and TA support for Canvas. This means that you have access to support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Canvas Support Hotline: 855-213-7130

support@instructure.com

Live Text Chat

The EEE team will still handle Canvas support for students, and will support the homegrown EEE+ suite of tools, including EEE+ GrandCentral. The EEE team can be reached Monday-Friday from 8AM-11AM, and 12PM-5PM at eee-support@uci.edu.

“Getting Started with Canvas” Webinars

OIT has partnered with the Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation (DTEI) to host a series of webinars that can help you get started with Canvas. Visit https://sites.uci.edu/teachanywhere/pedagogy/webinars/ to see the current schedule, or to view previously recorded sessions.

Legacy EEE Retirement Reminder

While this will have no effect on you for the Spring quarter, please note that the legacy EEE system will be retiring in November of this year. When you have time, we encourage you to download data from any legacy EEE tools that you may have used in the past. To help with this, we have created an EasyWebsite download tool that can be found here: https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/websitemanager/. For additional information about the retirement of the legacy EEE system, please visit: https://sites.uci.edu/canvas/.

As always, please contact us at eee-support@uci.edu if you have questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Briandy Walden

Associate Director, Student and Academic Services
