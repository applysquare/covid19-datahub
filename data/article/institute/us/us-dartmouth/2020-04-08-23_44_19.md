Topics

Information on the Hiring Freeze, April 4, 2020

The Office of Human Resources has information on the COVID-19 hiring freeze. The HR site includes the process for requesting recruitment and review of a position thought to be of critical need. It also has an FAQ on the hiring freeze.



Use of Face Coverings, April 4, 2020

The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, for example grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. The CDC says that recent studies have shown that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms and even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. See the CDC FAQs on wearing face coverings.



Out-of-State Quarantine for Those Returning to Campus and Visitors, April 1, 2020

COVID-19 is now widespread throughout the world and within the United States. In accordance with CDC and New Hampshire state guidance, individuals traveling to campus from outside New Hampshire (including visitors and those returning from other locations) should self-quarantine for a period of 14 days off campus. This does not apply to individuals making same-day trips to New Hampshire for essential, authorized work on campus. All visitors to campus are subject to the same guidelines as members of the campus community (including as it relates to remote work). Given the risk of transmission and restrictions on travel, and to protect everyone's health, visitors who are not authorized to be at Dartmouth should not be coming to campus.



Summer Off-Campus and Travel Update, March 30, 2020

Dartmouth has made the decision to suspend all undergraduate international programs for the full summer term and all domestic summer term programs scheduled for the months of June and July. This includes all summer term study-abroad undergraduate programs, including language study abroad (LSA), foreign study programs (FSP), and exchange programs; and Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships, research grants, and fellowships. Students who are pursuing leave-term opportunities that can be fulfilled remotely or with an alternative set-up from their current location and requiring no air travel may request an exemption from this policy. This decision does not apply to programs run by the graduate and professional schools, and students will be notified by their respective school regarding decisions about such programs.



Vermont/New Hampshire Stay-at-Home Update, March 27, 2020

Recent emergency orders from N.H. Gov. Chris Sununu and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott restricting and minimizing activities outside of the home permit Dartmouth to continue its existing arrangements for core campus operations and remote teaching and working. The safety and wellbeing of our employees is our highest concern during this difficult time. Employees who have questions about their ability to work on campus should speak with their supervisor/manager about their concerns.



Empathy and Inclusion Update, March 24, 2020

During this difficult time, it is important to practice empathy and inclusion. No one is at a higher health risk because of their racial, ethnic, cultural, or other identity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation about COVID-19 can spark fear and hostility that hurts people and makes it difficult to stay healthy. We are stronger as a community when we stand together against discrimination and share information that we know to be factual. See the CDC website for suggestions on combating social stigma during this health crisis.



Spring Term Changes, Update, March 17, 2020

We have made the decision that all spring term classes, both undergraduate and graduate, will be conducted by remote learning for the full term. There will be no in-person option to attend classes on campus after May 1. This was a difficult decision that we know will be frustrating and disappointing for many of our students. Unfortunately, we are not alone. Across the country, many colleges and universities are taking similar steps in reducing the number of people on their campuses as a way to protect communities from the COVID-19 pandemic.

We recognize that many students will have questions related to this transition to a full remote learning term, including financial questions. A group of administrators is working on further guidance related to billing and financial aid issues and will be in touch on this topic soon.

Throughout the 10-week term the Dartmouth campus will remain open, faculty and staff⁠—including union employees—will be paid as usual, and graduate students will continue to receive their stipends.

At the recommendation of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Geisel School of Medicine has suspended all clinical rotations, effective today. This includes clerkships and electives.



Tuck School of Business Spring Term, March 18, 2020

The Tuck School of Business is moving all MBA courses to remote-only learning for the entire spring term, with no option for students to attend class in person. To the extent possible, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities will also be delivered remotely during this time.



On-Campus Research Ramp-Down

Like many of our peer institutions, Dartmouth has decided to ramp-down and pause on-campus research activities. Our goal is to minimize in-person contacts to limit the opportunities for the spread of the novel coronavirus, including interactions among our researchers, support staff, and the public. This is not a decision to cease research or scholarship at Dartmouth. However, beginning on Monday, March 23, research staff and students must perform their scholarly work remotely, unless an extension for on-campus work has been granted to use a laboratory. We will be working with all members of the academic and funding communities to minimize the negative impact on faculty, staff, and students, each of whom will receive further information later today regarding this decision from the vice provost for research.

Faculty committee work, including tenure and promotion reviews and decisions, will continue to be conducted during spring term.



Athletics

The Ivy League presidents announced their unanimous decision to cancel all spring athletics competition and practices for the remainder of the academic year. In light of the pandemic, and the growing number of schools that have moved classes online for the rest of their semesters, it is no longer feasible for these competitions and practices to continue. This is a heavy blow to our student-athletes, who have sacrificed and trained so hard in their respective sports, and we regret the impact of these circumstances. The league also stated that winter teams and student-athletes who have qualified for postseason play will be able to participate in league competitions. However, the NCAA announced that all winter and spring championships have been canceled. Read the NCAA announcement.



Social Distancing

Social distancing means:

Remaining away from settings where people are meeting

Try to stay home and only go out for essentials reasons like food and medicine

Avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet) from others when possible

Remain alert for respiratory symptoms (a cough or shortness of breath) and fever.

Practice strict respiratory etiquette and hygiene. This includes covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not available.



If you have traveled from or transited through an area with a CDC Travel Health Notice Level 1 or 2, you are required to self-observe for 14 days. Monitor your health and practice social distancing.

If you feel feverish or develop a cough or shortness of breath, please seek health advice. Before going to a doctor's office or emergency room call ahead and tell the provider or office about your recent travel and symptoms. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House). Dick's House will monitor all students who should be in self-quarantine or self-isolation.



Self-Quarantine for 14 Days

Useful Definitions: Isolation and quarantine help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.

Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.

After March 4, 2020, if you are returning from a country with a CDC Travel Health Notice Level 3, you are required to self-quarantine for 14 days in accordance with current Dartmouth guidance.

Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House). Dick's House will monitor all students who should be in self-quarantine or self-isolation.

Take these steps to monitor your health and practice social distancing:

Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.

Stay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.

Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.

Avoid crowded places (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in public.

Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).



Teach Remotely

Guidelines for faculty on how to teach from anywhere can be found on Dartmouth's Teach Remotely website.



CDC Guidance to Higher Risk Individuals

Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is encouraging older people (60 years of age or more) and those with chronic

conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease to stay at home as much as possible. Early data suggests that older people are twice as likely to develop serious illness from the novel coronavirus. Individuals in these two groups should consider avoiding activities such as traveling by airplane, going to movie theaters, shopping in crowded areas, and attending religious services.
