All courses at BYU, including its Salt Lake Center, resumed March 18 through remote instruction. Some courses cannot reasonably meet remotely, such as lab courses or performance-based courses. College deans will communicate with departments about any specific exceptions. 

BYU encourages students to consider leaving campus and returning home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. Services and on-campus housing will continue to be available for those who choose to remain. 

All Spring term 2020 courses will be offered [only via remote instruction]( https://news.byu.edu/announcements/byu-to-continue-remote-learning-through-spring-term).
