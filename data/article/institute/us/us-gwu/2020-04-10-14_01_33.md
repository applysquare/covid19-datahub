Dear Faculty and Staff,

I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, GW faculty and staff have gone above and beyond to remain flexible and meet challenges as they arise. I am incredibly grateful for your continued hard work.

I write to share some announcements regarding the Summer 2020 semester.

Instruction. We expect restrictions on travel and gathering to be in place into the start of the summer semester. Thus, in addition to our regularly scheduled online courses, GW will make online accommodations to the courses that are scheduled to be taught in person for Summer 2020.

This means that courses will meet in an online format throughout the summer and that some classes previously scheduled may have to be canceled. Curriculum and courses with clinical training are being shifted for the summer. Clinical programs will reach out to students about the ways in which the curriculum is being adjusted. Students should continue to check the summer schedule for upcoming changes.

Housing, library and museum services. All residence halls will remain closed throughout the summer. In addition, the university will not provide intern or conference housing this summer.

Gelman Library, Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library and the Jacob Burns Law Library buildings will remain closed until further notice. All libraries remain open virtually with online support. Remote library services and resources remain available, although all library buildings will remain closed until further notice. Sharing of print materials is suspended during this time, but digitization of print materials may be available with longer turn-around times. This is dependent on the safety for staff to work in the building.

The George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum will remain closed until further notice.

Research. As per earlier guidance, research that can be conducted remotely will continue. Decisions when on-campus research activities can resume will be made separately.

Once again, thank you for all of your hard work during this challenging time.

Sincerely,

M. Brian Blake

Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
