Dear Resident Student,

As a follow-up to our previous announcement about financial assistance, we are providing more details about how a credit will be applied to your student account for the nightly rate of your residence hall room starting March 20 through the end of the semester for the extended virtual learning period. We hope this helps to limit any financial hardship you may face as a result of this transition.

The credit will be placed on your student account in the next few weeks. Once the credit has been processed, you will receive a notification from student accounts. After your credit is placed on your student account, a refund request can be made or the credit may remain on the account and be applied towards your housing for a future semester.

Please stay informed of the latest updates and prioritize your health and safety over the weeks to come.

Sincerely,

Mark Diaz

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Cissy Petty

Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students
