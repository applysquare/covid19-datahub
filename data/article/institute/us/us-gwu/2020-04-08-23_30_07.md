Dear GW Community,

In these past couple weeks our university has undergone enormous shifts as we respond to the COVID 19 crisis. Students have had their semester plans upended. Faculty members, in a short period of time, have been asked to determine how to offer the same consistently excellent education under sometimes very different circumstances. Staff members have worked tirelessly, both on-campus and off, to support these efforts. These transitions have allowed us to not only continue to operate, but to do so with the highest levels of care and service. We thank you for these efforts and the numerous ways that each of you have contributed to ensuring the safety of our GW community.

As President LeBlanc said in his message yesterday, this pandemic and the subsequent interruptions it has caused have been unprecedented in their magnitude. Our university’s response to it must therefore consider the scope of the crisis when determining the safest way forward. With this in mind, we have implemented the following:

Effective immediately, all employees who have been working remotely are required to continue teleworking until further notice.

Units with designated on-site employees will continue to have free parking on campus available to help promote social distancing during your commute. Please speak to your supervisor about your responsibility.

While your safety is critical, we must also approach this situation with care for your wellbeing. We have created a new paid time off option (PND) designed to support you as you care for yourself and your loved ones during this evolving situation. Further information on this enhanced leave option can be found on the GW Benefits website, along with the available FAQs, which will guide you through what you need to know.

As a reminder, GW’s live-answer Information Line for COVID-19-related questions is available from Monday through Friday (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and can be reached at 1-855-GWU-INFO (855-498-4636). This Information Line will assist faculty and staff with questions regarding university operations and will help connect community members with the appropriate offices and resources if they are unable to answer your specific questions.

As this period of teleworking extends past the original timeline, collaboration remains critical to combat the isolation and anxiety that come with the distance and constant news. Tools and best practices for working remotely are available on the GW COVID-19 website. Because of this distance, a lot of work and action often remain behind-the-scenes and hidden while teams are remote. We encourage you to use our Positive Vibes to make these gestures (both big and small) visible.

We wish you safety, health, and we continue to be grateful for your partnership moving forward.

Sincerely,

Dana Bradley

Vice President and Chief People Officer
