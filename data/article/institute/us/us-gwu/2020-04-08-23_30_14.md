Dear Students,

In light of the challenges you are facing this semester, the university has made some adjustments to academic policy in our various schools.

Importantly, these adjustments include the option for most undergraduate courses to be taken pass/no pass. Some exceptions apply. For guidance on your school and how you will receive more information, please review the below carefully.

The deans for ESIA, SEAS, GWSB, CCAS (including SMPA and the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design), Milken Institute SPH, and CPS have agreed on a common academic policy adjustment for undergraduate classes this semester. Students will have the option to take the undergraduate courses in these schools pass/no pass for this semester only. Students who still wish to complete these courses for a letter grade may continue to do so. Advising offices are aware of this change, and your school will follow up soon with more details on how this policy will be implemented. We encourage you to consult with academic, international, and military and veteran services advisors if you wish to use the pass/no pass option in any of your classes to ensure that you are still receiving letter grades in the courses that might affect your future plans, visa, or athletic status.

Separately, because of professional expectations and/or licensure issues, all graduate schools and professional programs are creating tailored responses concerning any academic policy adjustments. We include in this category not only all of our graduate schools but also undergraduate programs in SON and SMHS. If you have not already, you will soon receive more information on any adjustments to academic policies for this semester.

We understand that this is a particularly stressful time for you, and with these adjustments we want to give you flexibility while maintaining the academic rigor you expect and deserve from GW. We continue to be your partners in your academic journey, and we are working in every way we can to support your success.

Sincerely,

M. Brian Blake
