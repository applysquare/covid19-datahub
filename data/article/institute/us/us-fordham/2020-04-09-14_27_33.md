Governor Cuomo announced an executive order on Friday, March 20, mandating that all New York state businesses and non-profit organizations move 100% of their workforce off site, with a narrow handful of exceptions by 8 p.m. on Sunday, March 22, 2020.   
   
We are asking managers to implement a reduction in the on-site workforce per the order, with the exception of “essential” staff, as designated by the item numbers within the executive order. The spirit of the order is to have as few people on site as possible.
