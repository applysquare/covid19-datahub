We are postponing the 2020 University Commencement and diploma ceremonies because we cannot assume it will be safe to bring together the graduates, their families, and the campus community in May. [Read full details in Father McShane's message](https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/fordhams-175th-commencement-postponed/). We regret this set of circumstances and promise to reschedule as soon as we are assured by the CDC and state authorities that it is safe to do so.
