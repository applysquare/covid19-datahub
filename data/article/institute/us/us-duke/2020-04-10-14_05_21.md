Dear Duke Students,

Today we are opening up applications for funding from the Duke Student Assistance Fund which has been established to assist undergraduate, graduate and professional students with unexpected and extraordinary expenses related to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Students may now submit applications for grants using your Net ID at https://studentassistance.duke.edu. All applications will be reviewed individually by the Duke Student Assistance Fund team, which includes Student Affairs professionals who have experience with the many unique experiences of our students.

While the Duke Student Assistance Fund has been established with funds from the university, we are also receiving contributions from generous alumni and donors who want to help in providing relief to our students. The university has also created and funded similar relief efforts for patients at our hospitals and for the Durham community.

We know this is a challenging time for every member of our community, but at the same time we are all a source of inspiration and resilience for each other. Duke is committed to providing support for all of our community, particularly those members who have the most urgent and compelling needs, and we will continue to do so for the duration of this crisis and beyond.

Sincerely,

Sally Kornbluth, Ph.D.

Provost

This message was sent to all Duke undergraduate, graduate and professional students.
