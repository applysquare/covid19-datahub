Mar. 29, 2020 – Message from the Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the Provost’s Office for Inclusive Excellence

Many in our community are likely experiencing moments of anxiety and concern given the unprecedented times we are living in as a result of COVID-19.

We also acknowledge that an unfortunate reality has emerged in communities around the world—an increase in expressions of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiments, especially targeting the Chinese community.

Please know that Vanderbilt continues to be committed to fostering a safe and welcoming community that is inclusive and respectful of differences. As a university, we condemn expressions of hate, bias and discrimination in all forms.

If any member of our community has experienced harassment or bias related to concerns about the virus, or otherwise, we want to know as part of our commitment to creating and sustaining an inclusive community. Students should not hesitate to contact the Title IX and Student Discrimination Office to file a report about such conduct. Faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows are encouraged to file a report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office.

We also encourage those who are feeling anxious, have experienced losses, or otherwise need support in coping with the impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak to seek assistance. Students may contact the Office of Student Care Coordination regarding support resources. For faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is an important resource.

If you have ideas or suggestions on ways that we can better support you, we encourage you to share them with us by sending an email to either the Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion or the Provost’s Office for Inclusive Excellence.

As a reminder, please refer to the Vanderbilt University coronavirus website, particularly the FAQs, should you have any questions or concerns.

Above all, please practice care for yourselves, your communities and each other, particularly during this time when social distancing can make many feel isolated.

If there is anything that we can do to bring you clarity and comfort as these circumstances continue to unfold, we encourage you to reach out and let us know.

Regards,

André Churchwell

Interim Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion

William H. Robinson

Interim Vice Provost for Strategic Initiatives
