Apr. 3, 2020 – Remote work period extended through April 30

Dear colleagues,

As we near the end of our third full week of remote work for many staff members, we want to thank you again for your ongoing efforts, flexibility and ingenuity as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances.

In response to current guidance from public health experts and in alignment with local, state and federal directives related to social distancing, university leadership has decided to extend our remote work period through April 30.

During the first four weeks of remote work, we have been able to preserve staff pay and benefits, regardless of the nature of work or the source of funds. After careful financial analysis, we are pleased to be able to extend that same level of staff pay and benefit preservation through April 30. Pay and benefits will continue to be preserved during this time regardless of the nature of your work or the source of funds that support your position.

Your manager will be in direct contact with you to discuss your specific responsibilities during the remote work period. Details about how to record time in Oracle will be provided by your manager or HCM specialist and are posted in an FAQ in the HR section of our website.

We are taking these measures based on public health recommendations to protect our community’s health and to flatten the curve of the coronavirus disease’s spread.

In the weeks to come, university leadership will continue to monitor all developments closely and assess long-term financial impacts and how we will address those in order to ensure the continuity of our mission over the long-term. This includes evaluating all possible scenarios and necessary actions to support university operations after April 30, including any necessary changes to staffing levels and compensation. We will remain in communication with you, as will your manager, about next steps.

Please continue to monitor the HR information page and the telecommuting and remote work resources on the university’s COVID-19 webpage.

To echo Interim Chancellor Wente’s words from her last Open Mind column, the “members of Vanderbilt’s staff have done so much to increase our community’s safety, productivity and well-being.” Thanks to each of you for bringing this statement to life.

Sincerely,

Eric Kopstain

Vice Chancellor for Administration

Laura Nairon

Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for People and Business Services
