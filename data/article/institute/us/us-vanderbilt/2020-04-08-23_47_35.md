Mar. 26, 2020 – Summer 2020 schedule of undergraduate classes and registration

Dear Students,

We are sending this communication with an update about the Summer 2020 Schedule of Classes and registration.

All undergraduate classes for Summer 2020, including those offered in Maymester, will be offered through online instruction. We are updating the summer class schedule to reflect this information and any other changes to class offerings for the summer term. The updated Summer 2020 undergraduate class schedule will be published in YES on Sunday, March 29. Due to the changes to the summer class schedule, we encourage you to check the schedule frequently as we expect there may be additional classes added to the schedule over the next weeks.

Registration for undergraduate students for the Summer 2020 term will begin on Monday, March 30. Your registration information in YES has been updated to reflect the opening of summer registration on March 30.

Please be in contact with your academic adviser or your school’s Office of Academic Services if you have questions about how specific classes will count toward your degree requirements.

Please feel free to contact us if you have questions or need additional information.

Best wishes,

Office of the University Registrar
