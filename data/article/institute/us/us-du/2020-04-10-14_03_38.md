Dear DU Community,

As we focus considerable energy on the here and now—course work, health and safety, and staying socially connected through digital means—we also are looking at the longer-term implications of COVID-19 on University programs.

Based on elevated international and domestic travel warnings recently issued by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the U.S. Department of State, the University will be cancelling all international programs for the summer quarter and strongly recommends the suspension of all international travel until June 30, 2020. This will include all study abroad programs, experiential travel, and other group travel for students and faculty. By making this decision now, our academic units will be in a better position to plan alternate academic opportunities that also benefit students. It will also allow our students the chance to consider other options if they had been planning an international experience this summer.

Further, we are strongly recommending that all non-essential international and domestic employee travel be avoided until June 30.

Recommendations about fall study abroad programs will be shared towards the end of April since course registrations for fall quarter begin in early May.

We will continue to re-evaluate this travel policy and all related academic decisions, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. In the meantime, in order to comply with this recommendation, we ask that any travel planning be suspended until we have additional information and guidelines to share.

Sincerely,

Corinne Lengsfeld, Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor

Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, Vice Provost for Internationalization
