According to the Centers for Disease Control, COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel coronavirus not previously been seen in humans. The virus is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets, when an infected person coughs or sneezes when in close proximity to another person (within about 6 feet).

The University is in full compliance with the stay-at-home orders issued by Denver and Colorado. We're heeding the advice of health care professionals regarding physical distancing and following appropriate notification protocols. Building access is restricted to essential staff and to undergraduate students living in residence halls.

The CDC and the state health department are the best sources for up-to-date information on COVID-19. Consult your healthcare provider to learn about necessary health and safety precautions. To protect yourself from COVID-19, avoid close contact with people who are sick, don't touch your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and clean your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
