To: NYU Abu Dhabi Community



These are extraordinary times. We are grateful to all of you for how you are responding to our changing circumstances related to the global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Although we had originally committed to updating you next week, in light of the recent announcement made by President Andy Hamilton to the NYU New York community, we write today with important guidance for NYU Abu Dhabi.

Online and remote instruction for NYUAD will continue through to the end of the semester, but our students and other residents can remain on campus.

If we receive guidance at a later date from the UAE Ministry of Education that in-person instruction can resume, all classes will remain online, and can be finished online, but we would have some local accommodations for in-person work in labs and studio spaces.

We will be keeping our residences open and will continue to support all students who stay on campus. The dining halls, health center, and select other facilities will also stay open, with every proper precaution taken to ensure social distance. Limited access to research and teaching labs, the library, and studio spaces will be permitted, as has been the case so far, with appropriate precautions and social distancing in place.

We will be back to you shortly in more detail about our campus operations, facilities, and remote working guidelines which we will continue to maintain within a framework of community safety and public and individual health precautions.

The UAE has taken remarkable steps to limit the spread of the virus, including extensive testing and tracing, social distancing measures, and restrictions on travel. NYUAD continues to maintain a level of low health risk within our community, and we have put measures in place to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff.

We know that the changes in our academic and personal lives attendant on the global effort to fight coronavirus spread are hard. Our leadership team will continue to make decisions in a local, global, and NYU context to ensure that our students can continue their academic progress and our faculty research agendas are sustained while we limit risk to health and safety.

The measures we have had to put in place since the beginning of the epidemic are difficult, and we did not take these decisions lightly. They are also temporary, and the end of the semester is not far off. In the meantime, we are confident that NYUAD will emerge a stronger, even-more unified community for having come through these experiences together.

Sincerely,

MariÃ«t Westermann
