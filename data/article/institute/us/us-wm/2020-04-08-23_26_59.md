Jan. 25 | Informational Health Advisory

April 8, 2020 Dear faculty and staff, The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated many changes in a short period of time in both our work and personal lives. We understand it is a lot to navigate. The university as a whole is working hard to provide you with both regular updates and the resources you need. The central source of all of this information remains our COVID-19 website. Here are some updates and reminders regarding current university operations. Summer sessions and research. Both summer sessions are planned for remote delivery. The Provost sent detailed guidance about these and other summer programs to the campus community yesterday, April 7. Additional guidance for students, including information about final move-out, will be forthcoming.

Additional guidance for students, including information about final move-out, will be forthcoming. Telework. Telework should be the norm not the exception. All employees who can should be teleworking. This directive is now extended through June 12 . Because the university remains operational, some employees still will be on campus.

If your job duties require that you be on campus, please follow all the social distancing and health safety guidelines recommended by the Virginia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control. Employees who have concerns or supervisors who have questions should contact HR.

Back to the top COVID-19 Update XVIII: Governor's "stay-at-home" order March 30, 2020 Dear William & Mary community, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam issued a statewide “stay-at-home” order this afternoon. This order reinforces the guidelines on social distancing and restriction on congregating in groups of ten or more people he previously recommended. The new order does not impact our current operations. The directive is based on the advice of national and state health officials and continues to mean that all employees who can telework should do so. Faculty who must be on campus to conduct a lecture, should maintain a dedicated footprint (enter by the same door, visit the same office, use the same restroom) while in a university facility and then leave campus as soon as possible. Essential personnel should continue to be in contact with their supervisors. While the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over, either in our region or nationwide, we are at a pivot point operationally on campus. Moving forward, in addition to communication from the Emergency Management Team you will also receive communications directly from departments and units. The university’s COVID-19 website will remain a central source of information. We encourage you to refer to it often. This site was redesigned last week, we hope you find that helpful. If you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you may continue to submit them at the bottom of that page. Stay well and safe. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair

COVID-19 Update XVII: Office remain closed to public walk-in traffic, other updates March 20, 2020 Dear William & Mary community, Last weekend we announced that university offices would be temporarily closed to the public for walk-in access. Given the advice of federal, state and local health officials, we are extending that restriction through at least May 1. University offices remain operational and all employees who can work remotely should plan to telework through at least the end of the semester. This measure is part of a coordinated effort to support social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our area. Employees should not be on campus just because they prefer to work from their W&M office. Additionally, any member of this community who has been asked by public health officials to self-quarantine or self-isolate must follow those directives and should not be on campus. Please understand that these steps are being taken with the health and wellness of our entire community in mind. Everyone’s cooperation is greatly appreciated. Essential employees should continue to be in touch with their supervisors for their assignments. There has been a lot of information on a variety of topics this week. Our COVID-19 web hub, www.wm.edu/coronavirus, is the best central source for all information related to the university’s COVID-19 response. Highlighted below are a couple of items announced this week: Residence halls will close for the remainder of the spring semester for all students on Wednesday, March 25. Details related to this closure are available on the Residence Life website. Any residential student, including graduate and international students, with an issue or concern related to this should contact the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@wm.edu. We want to emphasize that in these difficult times, we remain committed to our William & Mary values of belonging and respect. This office is assisting students, international and domestic, in identifying viable options for accommodation based upon their individual situations, and they are in touch with those students.

In addition to university offices being closed to the public, university buildings are in a “locked, but not closed” status. Under this status, employees are reminded they need their card key or manual key to enter buildings. Students who are still on campus have access to their residence hall (until March 25) and the Commons.

And a couple of academic updates: Pass/Fail . The Provost’s Office has announced that Pass/Fail grading will be available for undergraduate courses through the end of the semester. Additional details are available on the University Registrar’s No Decision on Commencement . As President Rowe announced in her March 19 message to the W&M community, any decision on Commencement has been postponed until April. Summer Study Abroad . In light of COVID-19 developments around the world, including the US Department of State Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel as well as increasing travel restrictions in many countries, W&M has made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad programs. Students and faculty directly affected by these cancellations have been notified, and we are working to help support students as they adjust their academic plans. Remote Teaching & Learning . All in-person classes will be taught remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continuing through the end of the semester. Resources are available online to faculty, staff and students for both connecting remotely to university resources and faculty for remote teaching and learning strategies.

Also, we’d liked to remind each of you to take care of yourself. We have all experienced a lot of change in recent weeks and we need to take care of both our physical health and mental health. To aid in this, the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center has transitioned its in-house services to online delivery. We understand they had 160 members of our community “at” a yoga class this week. See the options at www.wm.edu/wellness/virtual. On that site is a special article on flourishing during unexpected change. We hope it will be a valuable resource for this community as we explore how to healthfully manage the wide range of emotions and thoughts associated with this challenging time. In true W&M fashion, look out for yourself and one another. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair

COVID-19 update XVI -- W&M Building access March 18, 2020 Dear William & Mary Community, In accordance with local and federal guidance, William & Mary continues to take steps to protect the campus community and do our best to slow the spread of COVID-19. With that in mind, effective this morning, William & Mary is instituting a “locked, but not closed” policy for all W&M buildings, including VIMS. This means W&M buildings will be locked and only accessible by electronic or manual key to faculty, staff and students who require entry. The university is also asking our community members to always lock doors behind them when entering a facility. If you require entry, but do not have a key, please contact W&M Police at 757-221-4596. William & Mary closed all offices to the public on March 16, and advised employees to work remotely wherever possible. Students have been strongly urged to physically leave campus if they can; only limited services are available and access may be restricted further in the coming days. The W&M Post Office is currently open with limited access from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The post office can be accessed through the sliding doors next to the Sadler Center loading dock. Community members whose buildings are locked can call 757-221-4491 to make arrangements for pick-up or delivery. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more. Please continue to reference www.wm.edu/coronavirus as the best source for all W&M-related information, including answers to frequently-asked questions, on COVID-19. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs Back to the top COVID-19 Update XV - Important Campus Update March 17, 2020 Dear William & Mary community, We know you have received a number of messages from the university in recent days regarding COVID-19. Thank you for your time. We want to be sure we are keeping you informed about this fluid situation. To that end, we wanted to make you aware that we learned today that a resident in Old Dominion Hall showed symptoms consistent with those of COVID-19 and is being tested. There is not a confirmed case.The university is in contact with the Virginia Department of Health and we are following all recommendations. You may have heard or seen that we had crews cleaning in that building. We did this out of an abundance of caution.The individual will remain under self-quarantine at another location and the university is currently providing support, including meals and healthcare. In accordance with privacy laws and our own policy, we will not be releasing detailed information in order to protect their privacy. William & Mary is a close-knit community and we know this message will generate both empathy and concern, especially for those who live nearby. Unless you are contacted directly by local or state health officials, you do not need to do anything specific as a result of this news. Please know we are doing all we can to not only support this member of our community but also protect the health and wellness of our entire community. If you have questions specifically related to area impact of COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health has opened a call center at 757-594-7069. Please check the Peninsula & Hampton Health District Facebook page for hours of operation. We announced earlier this week that all William & Mary campus offices would be closed to the public until at least March 23 as part of a coordinated statewide effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Additionally this week, Gov. Ralph Northam also announced the state was banning gatherings of 10 or more people. The university remains operational and just those students with extenuating circumstances remain on campus with limited services.Given the rapidly changing nature of this situation, we encourage any of those students still on campus to leave if you can. If you cannot leave, we encourage you to be ready with your personal emergency evacuation plan should it become necessary for us to close residence halls. If you have questions, you may contact residence life at living@wm.edu. As a reminder, the www.wm.edu/coronavirus website is the most up-to-date source about William & Mary’s response.

COVID-19 Update XIV – Governor’s Directive March 16, 2020 Dear William & Mary community, As part of a coordinated statewide effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, Gov. Ralph Northam has issued a directive closing executive branch and state facility offices in the Peninsula Health District, which includes William & Mary. In support of this directive, the university is closing all offices to the general public, effective noon today, for one week through March 22. This includes all W&M campuses, including VIMS. Classes remain on schedule to resume via online and distance platforms on Monday, March 23. Online classes currently underway will continue uninterrupted. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience as we navigate this rapidly changing situation. Please review the following guidance related to today’s announcement: Telework Employees should contact their supervisors and plan to work remotely if at all possible. Advance approval is not required for telework. Essential personnel should report as normal, unless advised otherwise by their supervisors. Other personnel may need to report as requested by their supervisors. Emergency Leave According to the governor’s directive, hourly wage employees, including adjunct faculty, who are unable to telework may use Public Health Emergency Leave provided by the state. The employees will be paid based on the hours they are normally scheduled to work each week. HR will provide additional details to eligible employees. Limited Campus Services We strongly advise all students to physically leave campus if they can. While William & Mary is not open to the public, the university will continue to provide essential services to students who remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances. We will provide students with additional information today on modified dining operations. Resources and Training IT developed a resource page of tools to assist with employees’ telework. Additionally, employees who need to take university desktops or laptops home to facilitate their work may do so for the duration of their telework arrangement. Supervisors received an email last week from HR regarding two virtual training sessions this week on supervising teleworking employees. One is scheduled for today and the other is planned for March 19. Please plan to participate in one of these sessions. Supervisors who have urgent questions on matters related to telework and alternate work arrangements, please e-mail hrguy@wm.edu. Employees with questions should contact their supervisors. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more.

COVID-19 Important Update XIII: Confirmed Case March 14, 2020 Dear William & Mary community, The university received confirmation today that a staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. As of this notification, this is the first and only case of COVID-19 involving a member of the W&M community. That is very likely to change in the near future as more cases are diagnosed in the surrounding Williamsburg area. In accordance with privacy laws and our own policy, we will not be releasing detailed information about this positive case or any subsequent cases. The Virginia Department of Health is in the process of contacting people who may have been in close contact with this individual. If you have received a call from VDH regarding self-quarantine, please follow their instructions. If you have not received a call, you do not need to take specific action related to this case but please continue practicing good preventative hygiene measures and limit close interaction with others as much as practically possible. We are in contact with VDH and are closely following their recommendations. Please remember that amidst this serious pandemic, the vast majority of affected individuals will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. Preparation, not panic, will provide the best assurance that the health of our community is protected. The campus remains open and operating under the interim policies announced March 11. William & Mary is a close-knit community and we know this message will generate both empathy and concern. Please know we are doing all we can to provide this member of our community support and protect the health and wellness of our community. If you have questions specifically related to area impact of COVID-19, VDH has a call center available at 757-594-7069. Check the Peninsula & Hampton Health District Facebook page for hours.

Back to the top Update XII: COVID-19 - Operational Details March 13, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – William & Mary leadership continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and develop the university’s response. We want to provide you additional details on the interim policies President Rowe announced in her March 11 message. Information and links are below and please remember that www.wm.edu/coronavirus is the best source for all W&M-related information. Thank you to all members of the community who continue to reach out and contact us via the website question box and the Call Center. Your feedback and information is very helpful in our planning and communications. Yesterday, we posted detailed frequently asked questions for faculty, staff and students. We are also reopening the Call Center this afternoon until 5 p.m. That number is 757-221-1565. Here are some important updates and reminders: Working Remotely. Over the coming weeks the university will continue normal administrative operations, albeit with some adjustments. These adjustments — in relative order of priority — include a) utilizing telework if appropriate b) practicing social distancing in work spaces, c) using flexible scheduling of staff and d) developing creative solutions. The health and safety of our employees is a priority and following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hygiene are the first and best courses for action. If an employee does not already have a current telework agreement, they should start the approval process by speaking with his/her supervisor. Supervisors will be flexible in allowing employees who have appropriate work and are able to work remotely to do so. Ultimately, approval by the unit vice president, vice provost, dean or their designee(s) is required to telework during the COVID-19 emergency. That approval will be obtained by the supervisor. Not all requests to telework can be approved due to the nature of the job. HR will be providing training sessions for supervisors on telework principles and policies March 16 and 19. Contact HR for details. Emergency Leave. With Governor Northam’s declaration of a state of emergency, university employees have access to Emergency Health Leave. This leave is available to both salaried and hourly employees and may be used for an employee’s own illness or to take care of an immediate family member. The leave is for illness or care directly related to COVID-19 and is to be used prior to any existing leave an employee may already have. Please contact HR if you have questions regarding eligibility. Residence Hall Access. Yesterday, Residence Life provided detailed information regarding residence hall access and student services. Swem Library has modified operating hours on its website and a list of building access times is available on the university’s COVID-19 website. Grading Guidance. The deadline for faculty to enter midterm grades for undergraduate courses has been extended to Sunday, March 29. Additionally, the deadline for undergraduate, graduate A&S and marine science students to withdraw for a grade of “W” from full-semester classes has been extended to Monday, March 30. Online instruction. As a reminder, the university has prepared this website to support the online instructional, remote learning and technology needs of faculty, students and staff as we transition to remote and online platforms. COVID-19 exposure/suspected exposure. Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to a positive case of COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider. Staff should also call their supervisors, and faculty should also call their deans. Students on campus should call the Student Health Center. Supervisors and deans should contact the Emergency Management Team and the Student Health Center. We will continue to update you regularly as the situation warrants. We recognize that this is a challenging and potentially anxious time. As we work through this together remember our shared goals and the strength of our community spirit.

We continue to respond to a rapidly evolving situation. Please continue to follow https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus for university updates. I was recently in Miller Hall at the Business School. Am I in danger? There is no known threat to the broader community. In these circumstances broad self-quarantining is not recommended by the CDC or the Virginia Department of Health.

Update IX: COVID-19 - Planning & Preparation March 9, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – There remain no known cases of COVID-19 on campus, however there are now three presumptive positive cases of the disease in patients in Northern Virginia. The Emergency Management Team and university leadership continue to meet regarding potential impacts of COVID-19 on campus. Specifically, we are looking at potential impacts to instruction, future events and university travel following the break. We will have additional information to you on Wednesday, March 11. As always, the safety and well-being of this community drive our decision making process. The most up-to-date information we have is available on the www.wm.edu/coronavirus website. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair

Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs This message was updated online to reflect the correct reference to the Virginia cases as presumptive positive cases - Ed. Back to the top Update VIII: COVID-19 - Spring Break March 6, 2020 Dear William & Mary community - Spring break is here. Please enjoy a safe, healthy and relaxing time. Many of you have had questions regarding campus events. At this time, the only changes announced by the university involve study abroad and university-sponsored international travel. Anyone taking a personal trip over the break is reminded to follow CDC guidelines regarding restricted travel locations and, in the case of international travel, protocols and requirements for reentry into the United States. Links to those resources are available at www.wm.edu/coronavirus. This website remains the best source for information and updates related to our campus community and COVID-19. Also included on that site are FAQs regarding actions the university has taken and preparations related to COVID-19. There is also a comment box should you have a question that isn’t already addressed in the FAQs. Feedback and questions received via our online form will help inform future campus messages and information we include on the website. Over the break, please pay extra attention to the recommendations of health officials for the prevention of catching and spreading COVID-19, especially washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and following CDC guidelines for quarantine or self-isolation if you have traveled. Upon your return, we expect the university to be operating under a normal class schedule. The Emergency Management Team will continue to monitor this situation and inform you of any updates. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair

Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VII: COVID-19 - Spring Break & Ongoing Communications March 4, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – As you prepare for spring break and potentially leaving campus, please pay close attention to recommendations and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. The status of COVID-19 is changing rapidly both the United States and a number of countries overseas. Domestically, Covid-19 is now reported in 13 states and more than 75 other countries worldwide. If you are planning personal travel abroad over the break, please be advised that travel warning and restrictions are very fluid. Leaving the country at this time includes the risk of potentially not being able to leave the country you visit and/or delays or quarantines in returning to the United States. Anyone who is not a U.S. citizen should be especially aware of the possibility of U.S. government restriction on reentry. State Department and CDC websites are the best sources of the most up-to-date- information related to overseas travel. All official information on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it will continue to come from the W&M Emergency Management Team (Sam Jones in your Inbox). The information we share is important and we ask that you review each of these messages carefully. The Reves Center, and its Global Education website, are the information source for those who are currently studying abroad, or plan to do so in the summer or fall. Please contact the Reves Center as you have questions. The university will continue to update the website https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus on a daily basis so it remains a primary source for the most up-to-date information. Once you return to William & Mary, our focus will continue to be on prevention. All the standard rules apply. Wash your hands frequently and long enough to make a difference. Do not share water bottles, etc. If you are sick, go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not go to class, and faculty and staff should not come to work. Cough into you sleeve, or into a tissue which should be immediately discarded. Wipe down work and study spaces with a disinfectant. While these actions may seem basic, they are fundamental to preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as other diseases. This video from Student Health Center Director Dr. David Dafashy is a good reminder of general COVID-19 information and prevention tips. Have an enjoyable and safe spring break. We look forwarding to seeing you back on campus and expect to be operating under a normal schedule for both classes and events. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair

Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VI: COVID-19 - New Travel Restrictions March 2, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – You have likely heard that travel warnings to both Italy and Iran were elevated over the weekend due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Given these additional warnings, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is now currently prohibited to Italy, China and South Korea and all other countries on our restricted destinations list. This new prohibition means that undergraduate students may not remain in Italy on university-sponsored travel at this time. The university’s Global Education Office is working individually with any of our students impacted by this. No decisions have been made yet regarding summer study abroad. The university is currently assessing the viability of specific summer programs and will be in contact soon with applicants. If you have additional questions regarding study abroad visit the Reves’ Global Education Office webpage. Centralized information and resources related to COVID-19 are available at https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus. Please continue to reference this site for the most up-to-date information. The Emergency Management Team continues to look at the best preventative actions for the university moving forward and the administration will ask each department and unit on campus to think about its continuity of operations plan should COVID-19 spread to our region. Again, all of this is preparatory. To date, there remain no confirmed cases of the disease either at William & Mary or in the state of Virginia. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health are encouraging anyone who has not yet had the flu vaccine to get one. If you have not had a flu shot this year, please consider doing so. Most local pharmacies are good sources for the vaccination. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair

Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update V: COVID-19 - Action/Resources Feb. 28, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – The university continues to take preventative and preparatory steps related to COVID-19 in accordance with university policy and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Virginia Department of Health guidelines. Centralized information and resources related to the disease are now available at https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus. You may continue to reference this site for the most up-to-date information as this situation moves forward. Members of William & Mary’s Emergency Management Team are in regular contact with VDH and are coordinating with other state agencies and community partners to implement COVID-19 containment strategies, should they be necessary. Facilities Management staff continue to disinfect high-touch areas across campus including doorknobs, railings and banisters. As a reminder, dining services has hand sanitizer stations available in the Commons, Center Court at Sadler and at the Marketplace. If you are studying abroad, or are planning to do so soon, there is additional information for you on Reves’ Global Education website. If your spring break travel plans have changed, a reminder that the residence halls will remain open during spring break though dining services will have limited operations. Visit dining.wm.edu for spring break hours. Chick-fil-A on Richmond Rd. will be open 11 a.m. – 8 p.m. over spring break and Dominos will also be open, both locations accept dining dollars associated with meal plans. Any student planning to remain on campus over the break may also stock up on convenience/grocery items from the Student Exchange and Tribe Market using meal plan dining dollars before it closes on Friday March 6. While there are still NO confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Virginia, the CDC and VDH are urging citizens to follow official guidelines regarding travel and take extra precautions against contracting or spreading the disease. The most recent information may be found on their websites. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair

Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update IV: New Travel Advisories/Spring Break Feb. 26, 2020 Dear William & Mary community – The university and its Emergency Management Team are monitoring developments here and around the world related to the COVID-19 virus. We are closely following university policy as well as guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the Virginia Department of Health. Thankfully, there remain no reported cases of the virus at William & Mary and no confirmed cases in Virginia. Yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued additional travel warnings based on growing reports of COVID-19 cases in Europe and Asia. With spring break just a week away, we wanted to be sure to alert you to those updates. Currently, CDC recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to both China and South Korea. Additionally, they advise travelers to consider postponing nonessential travel to Iran, Italy and Japan due to the growing number of cases in those countries. Spring Break and Other Travel Spring Break runs March 7-13. Please follow all travel restrictions or warnings issued by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the State Department if you are planning to travel outside the country. Based on CDC and State Department warning levels and in adherence with university policy, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is currently prohibited to China and S. Korea. All university-sponsored faculty, staff and graduate student travel to those countries must be reviewed and approved by the university’s International Travel Review Committee. As we have previously communicated, information related to overseas travel is available on the Reves Center’s Travel Alert page. Travel warnings and alerts are quite fluid; if you are planning to travel overseas please continue to reference this webpage.

Preventive measures for COVID-19 are the same as those recommended for colds and seasonal flu. The CDC recommends the following guidelines – stay home when sick; wash hands regularly; avoid touching public surfaces; cover nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing; seek medical care if feeling ill.

Dear William & Mary community –



Given the media attention surrounding the spread of the 2019n-CoV virus, we wanted to provide you with the following information.



Information related to 2019-nCoV, its symptoms or how it can spread is available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html On that website the CDC says that while they consider the virus a “serious public health threat,” they see the immediate health risk to the general American public as low based on current information. The university has no reports of the virus on campus and we are aware of no cases in Virginia. The university continues to monitor this situation and is ready with its infectious disease protocol when warranted.



If you traveled in areas now impacted by the virus over the recent winter break and have any concerns about your health, please contact the Health Center at 757.221.4386.



The CDC issued a “Warning – Level 3” travel alert – the agency’s highest – for Wuhan, China on January 23 advising travelers to avoid all nonessential travel there. The agency has indicated an expansion of the travel warning could come as early as next week.



Anyone planning to travel to China in coming weeks should contact Steve Hanson, vice provost for international affairs and director of the Reves Center for International Studies, if you have concerns related to university-affiliated travel. He may reached at sehanson@wm.edu. The Reves Center monitors travel alerts and advisories closely.
