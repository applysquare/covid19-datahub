OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR March 26, 2020

ALL SENATE FACULTY MEMBERS AT UC SAN DIEGO SUBJECT: Deadline Extension: 2020-21 Course Development and Instructional Improvement Program (CDIIP) In light of the unprecedented circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are extending the 2020-21 CDIIP Application deadline to Friday, April 24, 2020. The application is available at: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html CDIIP provides funding to support faculty projects that enhance undergraduate instruction and to encourage faculty experimenting with new instructional technologies including the creation of digital resources and the development of hybrid or flipped courses. Funding is available in two forms: Small Projects ( Other Projects ( The CDIIP Committee looks for projects that can improve the quality of undergraduate education, impact many students, improve time-to-degree, and increase interactions between faculty and students. We especially encourage proposals that address the varied needs and perspectives of our diverse student population. Faculty members are encouraged to develop projects with comprehensive strategies to improve undergraduate instruction in collaboration with their departments or academic units and the Teaching + Learning Commons (http://commons.ucsd.edu/). Faculty members are also encouraged to consult with the Library for assistance in identifying topical ebooks, media, open educational resources, digital scholarship tools, and other information resources already available to faculty and students. Proposals for funding are reviewed by the CDIIP Committee. The Executive Vice Chancellor â€“ Academic Affairs makes final allocation decisions. The CDIIP is not specifically aimed at supporting the development of fully-online classes. However, faculty interested in developing online classes are encouraged to discuss their interests with the Digital Learning Hub (https://digitallearning.ucsd.edu/). Alternate avenues of support for course development in these cases may be available (e.g. the UCOP Innovative Learning Technology Initiative: http://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/ or through the EVC Office Educational Innovation initiative: Contact wettouati@health.ucsd.edu or gchemingway@ucsd.edu for information). Application Criteria: Full-time senate faculty who are engaged in undergraduate education are eligible to submit proposals.

Awards are made in the form of grants to cover expenses including but not limited to faculty release time, faculty summer support, summer undergraduate/graduate student support, support for Educational Technology Services or other technical assistance, materials, or other justifiable expenses.

Applications must include a plan for assessing student learning outcomes and for sustaining the project efforts beyond the duration of the grant.

A progress report for each CDIIP award is due on June 15 of the following year.

A letter from the department chair and endorsement from the Commons and/or Educational Technology Services are also required for many grants applications (see website for details: https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/evc/cdiip.html). Awards will be announced in early June 2020. Funds will be available after July 1, 2020. Please contact John Moore, Dean of Undergraduate Education (DUE@ucsd.edu), for questions regarding the CDIIP.
