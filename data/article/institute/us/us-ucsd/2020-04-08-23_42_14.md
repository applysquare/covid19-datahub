OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR March 29, 2020

ALL ACADEMICS, STAFF AND STUDENTS AT UC SAN DIEGO SUBJECT: Welcome to Spring Quarter, Precautions for Campus Residents, COVID-19 Updates Welcome to UC San Diego’s Spring Quarter. Today we make Triton history as together we embark upon our very first virtual quarter. All courses and student experiences will be conducted remotely to stop the spread of coronavirus. Instructors and students are asked to become familiar with academic continuity tools and are invited to join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning at https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html. Technical resources for instructors are available at https://keepteaching.ucsd.edu and https://aps.ucsd.edu/facdev/covid-19/index.html. Technical resources for students are available at https://keeplearning.ucsd.edu; https://commons.ucsd.edu/covid-19/students.html; and https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/news/covid-19-info.html. Instructors and staff have been busy preparing for today, working to create a smooth transition to virtual formats. This quick turn-around means there will be bumps. We ask that everyone practice courtesy during the first two weeks of the quarter as we all find our bearings and adjust. We are all in this together, so be kind to one another, help each other over the phone and online when possible, and extend patience, empathy and compassion when experiencing hurdles. RETURNING FROM SPRING BREAK: PRECAUTIONS Campus residents returning from New York, New Jersey, or Louisiana are asked to self-isolate for 14 days until the concern about COVID-19 transmission is over, since the CDC reports that these areas are experiencing surges in virus transmission. Self-isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people for the full 14-day period. Self-isolation may require a temporary move to another space on campus. Housing and Dining Services will be providing meal delivery service for students with a meal plan during self-isolation. Any student returning to on-campus housing from these three locations should log in to the Housing Portal at https://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/currentresidents/pages/ and complete the return form. STAY-AT-HOME ORDER & STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT California is under a “stay-at-home” executive order issued by Governor Gavin Newsom. This means going out for purposes other than ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES is a fineable act with a $1,000 fine or up to six months in jail according to San Diego County Sheriff William Gore. Examples of essential activities are medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to secure groceries and necessary supplies. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities, please observe strict social distancing. The objective of social distancing is to reduce the probability of contact between persons carrying an infection, and others who are not infected, so as to minimize disease transmission. Provide six feet between you and anyone else you may come into contact with. “Flattening the curve” and maintaining the health and wellbeing of our community is everyone’s responsibility. With this in mind, we want to be transparent that any failure to comply with self-quarantine or related orders risks the health and safety of our community. As such, it may violate the Student Conduct Code with respect to Section VII (P) Failure to Comply, and Section VII (H) Health & Safety, and will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for follow-up. OUR PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY IN THE ONLINE CLASSROOM Our goal is to deliver the best educational experience possible, even under these difficult conditions. Observing our Principles of Community (https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) in the virtual classroom environment will help us to create and maintain a positive and vibrant online learning community. Recognize and take into consideration that our richly diverse cultures and life experiences will influence our online engagement. Treat each other with respect and the dignity we all deserve. If you witness or experience online behavior that constitutes harassment or discrimination, remember to report it to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) at https://ophd.ucsd.edu. THANK YOU & BEST OF LUCK THIS QUARTER We would like to thank our hard-working staff, faculty, and student leaders for their incredible work to prepare us to have a spring quarter on time and in a new format. We appreciate all that you are doing to make our remote UC San Diego presence a strong Triton community. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together. Your continued compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus and set an example for everyone. Thank you for your continued cooperation.
