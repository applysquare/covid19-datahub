To the Campus Community:

Our priority during the COVID-19 crisis is to protect the health and safety of our Bruin community. Despite the challenges we face, we will continue to take steps that support our teaching mission. Based on the rapidly developing situation and new data every day, we have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely through Summer Session A, which starts June 22 and ends August 28. We ask faculty and staff to plan accordingly.

We recognize that there will be courses with specialized equipment or field work that may not be able to be conducted remotely. We ask faculty to consider ways to modify courses given these constraints.

For Summer Session C, which starts August 3, we will make a decision at a later date and will keep you informed. However, faculty are strongly advised to begin planning how remote teaching would impact Session C courses given the real possibility that the public health situation may require us to convert Session C to remote instruction as well.

Based on the unique learning needs of some academic units, we are deferring a decision for Session A courses and programs, and other summer programs, offered by the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Dentistry, and by UCLA Extension.

The Summer Sessions webpage will be continuously updated as we finalize remote teaching course availability for this summer.

The facts related to COVID-19 are changing rapidly, so please routinely check with UCLA information sources for updates. The most up-to-date information can be found online at UCLAâ€™s COVID-19 website, and emergency updates and resources are always available at Bruins Safe Online.

We ask all Bruins to remain flexible, and we appreciate your patience during this evolving situation.

Sincerely,

Emily A. Carter

Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost
