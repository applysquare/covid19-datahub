To: Deans and Department Chair: Extension of Graduate Thesis and Dissertation Submission Deadlines for Winter Quarter

Dear Colleagues:

To ensure that graduate students are impacted as little as possible by the rapidly changing events associated with COVID-19, the Graduate Council has voted to extend dissertation, thesis and capstone project filing deadlines from March 20, 2020 to April 10, 2020 for the winter 2020 quarter. The Graduate Division is working closely with the Registrar to implement this change.

The Graduate Council will re-evaluate this policy in early spring in accordance with campus recommendations regarding COVID-19.

Please forward this information to the staff and/or faculty in your department.

With best wishes,

Robin L. Garrell

Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Dean of the Graduate Division

Andrea M. Kasko

Chair of the Graduate Council
