NC State Community and Friends,

In response to the spread of COVID-19, and to help ensure the health and safety of the campus and broader community, NC State is canceling all university-related in-person academic, athletic and 4-H summer 2020 camps for K-12 students. This includes camps on NC State’s campus in Raleigh and at other locations.

Attendees who have already registered and paid for camps will be contacted by the host regarding refund options. Several academic-focused camps are working to move their programs online; please check with the hosting college or unit for details. Existing online summer camps and activities will continue as previously planned.

As the university anticipates the healthy return of students, faculty, staff and friends in the fall – on campus and at our programs across the state – we hope the timing of this camp decision provides students and parents with plenty of time to effectively plan for a productive and enjoyable summer.

Please keep up with NC State COVID-19 related updates and information at www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus.

Thank you.
