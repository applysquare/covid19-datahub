Dear Class of 2020,

Over the last few weeks, COVID-19 has significantly disrupted our university’s operations – and the lives of all NC State students, faculty and staff – in ways we couldn’t have imagined when we started the spring semester in January. Unfortunately, those disruptions continue.

Given the evolving nature of COVID-19 and based on current recommendations from healthcare officials, we have made the difficult decision to postpone – not cancel – all spring 2020 commencement exercises.

We know you have worked incredibly hard and looked forward to graduation day for a long time. We understand this is not only an important milestone for you, but also for your families and loved ones. We are very proud of you all – undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and professional students who will soon graduate – and we look forward to celebrating your success with commencement exercises when it is safe to do so.

Be assured, this will not impact the completion of your degree requirements. You will still graduate on time.

We’ll release more information about updated commencement plans in the weeks ahead. In the meantime, thank you for your flexibility and understanding. Although this semester doesn’t look like what we had planned or hoped for, I encourage you to do all you can to stay healthy, stay focused and finish strong.

Randy Woodson,

Chancellor
