We hope all in the NC State community are staying safe and healthy as our Pack continues to navigate the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We’re in our second week of online courses, and NC State remains open with minimal on-campus operations, but that does not diminish our institution’s commitment to provide critical services to our community.

As COVID-19 continues to spread, a great amount has changed throughout the world, across our country and in our campus community over recent weeks and even the last few days.

Please take a few minutes to review the following important COVID-19-related campus updates.

Minimal On-Campus Operations to Continue Through At Least April 30

As federal and state leaders, along with healthcare professionals, have encouraged physical distancing practices, the UNC System has provided additional direction that System universities should continue operating with minimal on-campus personnel through at least April 30.

In a memo shared yesterday by Provost Arden and Vice Chancellor Maimone, NC State announced COVID-19 Special Faculty and Staff Leave Provisions, including updated guidance related to remote and mandatory work, that will be in effect April 1-30. The new guidance makes it clear that only employees designated as mandatory should be on campus at any time. Click here to read the full memo.

If you have questions regarding the new COVID-19-related leave provisions, please contact your college, division or unit HR representative or University Human Resources. For more COVID-19 guidelines and resources, visit the HR website.

Facility Closures and Changes

To support physical distancing and to help slow the spread of COVID-19, NC State has implemented the following facility changes and updates.

Effective March 30 at 5 p.m., Talley Student Union is closed until further notice. For specific needs or questions related to Talley Student Union or Witherspoon Student Center services, please contact the virtual information desk at uscinformationdesk@ncsu.edu.

Effective March 30 at 5 p.m. and until further notice, D.H. Hill Jr. Library is closed, but the Libraries’ expanded online collections and expanded services remain available. For information about the Libraries’ expanded online and technology services, visit the Libraries’ Coronavirus Response page.

For dining needs, Fountain Dining Hall will be open limited hours from 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 – 7 p.m. daily for take-out only for the on-campus community.

Student Health Services remains available to maintain ongoing health care (such as medication refills, follow-up regarding laboratory tests and brief questions) via secure messaging in the Healthy Pack Portal. A limited number of in-person appointments for acute illness are available for students and need to be made by calling 919-515-2563. Visit the Student Health Services website for more information.

The Wolfpack One Card Office has moved its operations to Fountain Dining Hall, 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. Monday through Friday or by appointment by calling 919-515-3090.

All NC State Stores physical locations (Wolfpack Outfitters, Wolf Xpress, State of the Art) are closed, but online stores are open at ncsu.edu and shop.gopack.com.

Keep up with campus facilities and services hours and operations on the university’s coronavirus response web site.

Tracking and Reporting COVID-19 Cases

The efforts made by the university to reduce campus population and encourage social distancing, combined with other preventative health measures can help keep you, your loved ones and our entire community safe. However, there will inevitably be several in our broad community who test positive for the virus.

University health officials have recently confirmed that a handful of members of the Wolfpack have tested positive and are either in isolation, receiving care or recovering away from campus. None of these individuals have been on campus or been in contact with other members of the campus community while ill.

As COVID-19 continues to spread and we learn about additional positive cases, know that our health professionals will follow up on each one to determine if there is any risk to our on-campus community, regardless of where the individual lives. Going forward, we will only send notification of cases that have direct impacts to campus.

If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed positive for the virus, we encourage you to let us know by filling out one of the appropriate forms for students or for faculty/staff. This information is completely voluntary and confidential – it helps university healthcare professionals monitor the impact to the campus community and provide any resources and support you might need wherever you are.

Reimbursements for Housing and Dining

Yesterday, NC State announced that we will be providing prorated refunds to students for their unused housing and dining plans this semester.

Since costs of specific housing and dining plans vary per student, once determined, the credit will be posted to the student account.

It will take some time for the university to calculate reimbursements and we will update you with specifics about the timing of refunds in the upcoming weeks.

Stay Alert for More Information

As NC State navigates through this unprecedented time, please stay alert for more important communications in the days ahead. In the meantime, keep up with COVID-19 related updates, information and a growing collection of helpful resources at www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus.

Thank you for all you are doing to keep NC State safe, healthy and moving forward.
