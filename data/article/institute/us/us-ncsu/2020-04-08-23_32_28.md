NC State Students and Parents,

We are pleased to inform you that NC State will provide prorated refunds to students for their unused housing and dining plans this semester.

During a special meeting of the UNC Board of Governors today, Interim President Bill Roper announced that the UNC System is committed to prorated reimbursements of housing and dining as a result of the University Systemâ€™s rapid response to COVID-19.

Since costs of specific housing and dining plans vary per student, once determined, the credit will be posted to the student account. It will take some time for the university to calculate reimbursements and we will update you with specifics about the timing of refunds in the upcoming weeks.

Please keep up with NC State COVID-19 updates and information at www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus.
