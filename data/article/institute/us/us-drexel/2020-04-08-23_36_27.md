​The following message was sent to Drexel faculty and staff on March 20.

As announced on Thursday evening, Governor Wolf has issued a shutdown of most businesses and schools in Pennsylvania to help stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus. If there is anything you need from your campus office, we ask that you pick it up as soon as possible today, no later than 5 p.m., and return home promptly thereafter. Only those faculty and professional staff members who are deemed critical personnel, such as Drexel police officers, dispatchers, designated facilities personnel, etc., should report to work on campus to maintain critical operations. All other faculty and professional staff should work remotely to promote social distancing.

To prepare the majority of our faculty and professional staff members to effectively work remotely, we have listed important reminders and information below. Please continue to monitor Drexel's Response to the Coronavirus for the most current official information. FAQs are listed on the site with consistent updates.

Preparing for Campus Closure and Remote Work:

Obtain approval from your department head if you are requesting to remove any type of property from Drexel’s premises.





Consult with your immediate supervisor to understand work expectations during this unique situation.





Consider Direct Deposit if you are currently receiving a paper check. Instructions are provided on theOffice of the Comptroller's website.

Campus Facilities and Services as of March 23:

Faculty, professional staff and students will continue to have access to Drexel-owned buildings via their DragonCards; however, all but those who are deemed critical personnel and required to be on campus will work remotely.

If you have questions related to specific circumstances in your work environment and/or the resources available to you, contact your HR Business Partner.





Continue to maintain normally scheduled team meetings and 1:1 staff meetings.

Technology Resources:

Drexel IT has developed a resource page on the IT website that explains the technology tools available to faculty and professional staff and the situations where each tool is best suited. Consult this page for information on Collaborate Ultra, Zoom, and Teams. You’ll also find guidance on the limits of each service, suggestions to handling large events, and ways to request support. The IT website also provides guidance on how to connect remotely to Drexel resources and services.

Most importantly, be sure to take care of yourself and each other, and know when and how to seek help. Drexel offers an Employee Assistance Program administered by Lincoln that provides confidential, 24/7 counseling online or via toll-free phone call. For more information, please call 888.628.4824 or view the Lincoln Employee Assistance Program Brochure [PDF].

We truly appreciate all your flexibility, efforts and dedication to the University in making this fluid situation work as best we can while balancing your operation and personal obligations under these uncertain circumstances.

Sincerely,

Helen Bowman

Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer
