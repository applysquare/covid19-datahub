What can I do if I have Housing/Move-out questions?

If you have any questions, please contact Housing and Residence Life at housing@drexel.edu. For immediate assistance, you may also contact the Front Desk of your residence hall at any time, or in case of an urgent situation, contact Public Safety at 215.895.2822.

What should I do if I have mail arriving on campus after it has closed?

For packages being shipped to campus, please contact the supplier to cancel or hold the order. Shipping and receiving will continue to hold packages, but storage is limited and strained. If a received package is needed, contact Shipping and Receiving at 215.895.2817 to schedule a pickup at the receiving window on the first floor of the General Services Building Monday through Friday, between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. Delivery service will not be an option at this time.

After I leave for spring break, can I access my room for personal belongings?

After finals week, all students will be required to vacate their on-campus residence. On-campus residents are defined as students living in Drexel residences or fraternity and sorority housing. For students who have left campus for the lengthened spring break and/or are unable to return to campus by Friday, March 20, 2020, University and Student Services provides storage options for a fee. Click here to schedule service with USS. Students who have left campus for the lengthened spring break and/or are unable to return to campus by Friday, March 20, 2020, will have the option to leave their personal belongings in their room assignment. Students who leave their belongings in their rooms do so at their own risk, although Drexel Public Safety will continue to secure and check in on all residences. The University shall not be liable for any loss or damage to a resident’s personal property, whether such loss or damage is caused by fire or another casualty, theft, or any other cause. Housing and Residence Life will follow-up with more information in the upcoming weeks regarding coordination to remove personal belongings. The residence halls and Fraternity and Sorority Housing will remain inaccessible to students after Move-Out until further communication.

Are residential students being asked to remove all personal belongings and move out completely?

We have sent messages to all residential students about our move-out process, which started this week and was set to continue this weekend through next Wednesday, March 25. However, due to the governor’s order, we must move quickly to have students move out of Drexel housing as soon as possible. To that end, all Drexel residential students (other than those specifically noted below) will be required to leave their on-campus residence as soon as they complete their last final exam March 20. Residential students need to be out of Drexel housing by midnight on Friday, March 20, 2020. As noted in our recent messaging, students can leave their personal belongings in their current space. We will be back in contact with all on-campus students in the next few weeks with further details about a future move-out time. For the limited number of students who applied for an exemption for spring housing and were granted that request, please know that Drexel residence halls will remain open for all of you, as well as for those of you who are unable to leave campus until this weekend (or early next week) because of pre-existing travel arrangements. Questions should be directed to housing@drexel.edu.





What if I have a dining suggestion?

Ask to speak with a manager at any Drexel Campus Dining location, or email CampusDining@drexel.edu.

I don’t want to hand my DragonCard to a cashier anymore – is there an alternative to making my purchase?

Yes. Download the GET App (search for GET in your app store) and log in using your Drexel Connect credentials. Each Campus Dining point of sale can accept the GET App as a form of payment using their customer-facing barcode scanner.

Are the self-serv kiosks at Urban Eatery cleaned regularly?

Yes. In addition, please remember that the kiosks are optional. All purchases can occur via the cashier as well.

Are students required to stay home following spring break?

Per the March 16 University Message titled: “Entire Spring Term to be Taught Remotely; Clinical Experiences Suspended; On-Campus Research Activities Restricted,” all students will be required to vacate their on-campus residence. On-campus residents are defined as students living in Drexel residences or fraternity and sorority housing. All students who can depart for their permanent residence should do so as soon as finals are complete.

Can students still have visitors if living in University Housing?

Effective March 17, guests will not be permitted to sign in. We are suspending guest privileges in the residence halls and Fraternity and Sorority Housing. Building access will be limited to residents and Drexel essential personnel. Family members and friends who come to campus to assist with personal belongings will be permitted building access for two hours Monday – Sunday, 7:00am – 11:00pm. Failure to adhere may result in assessment of a fee and/or conduct charge.

Will I be charged for housing and dining for Spring Term now that the residence halls will be closed?

Students who depart campus will not be charged for housing or dining for the Spring term. This includes students who have left campus but still have personal belongings in their room assignment. Cancellations for Spring Quarter students are currently being processed and this will be reflected on the Drexel eBill within the next 1-2 weeks.

What support (or resources) are being provided to assist with removal of my personal belongings?
