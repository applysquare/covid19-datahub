The following message was sent to Drexel faculty and staff on April 27.

Dear Colleagues,

Now that we have a course set for the summer term, during which the University will continue to operate remotely, we are moving ahead with an intensive planning effort for the beginning of the new academic year. I’m pleased to announce the members of the task force assembled to explore our approach to teaching, research and service for the fall, and I want to briefly outline their charge.

We continue to see the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with its tragic toll in human life and the sweeping disruption of our economy. In addition, it remains unclear when communities might be able to resume some semblance of their normal routines. And so, we must be extremely flexible with our planning, anticipating a number of different scenarios. To that end, our Fall 2020 Covid-19 Task Force under the leadership of three co-chairs will evaluate several options. They are as follows:

Fall term begins and remains on campus, with social distancing protocols in place.

Fall term continues to operate solely remotely; campuses remain closed.

Fall term runs as a hybrid, with varying elements online and in-person

I asked the task force, at their first meeting on Friday, to identify the dimensions and permutations of each scenario, as well as address any potential questions that may arise. The group will consider how each scenario would impact Drexel in various ways, including: academics, research, facilities, health and safety, student life and more.

Any move to resume on-campus operations will be made only after state and local authorities lift restrictions on business and school openings, and once the University concludes that safeguards can be put in place to minimize health risks from COVID-19 to the entire Drexel community. As the summer progresses, we do hope to open the campuses on a limited basis, possibly involving small groups of students and researchers, additional faculty, professional staff and other personnel necessary to conduct University business. For example, some labs could reopen.

I want to thank the members of the task force for taking on this important challenge, and l look forward to receiving their recommendations in early June. Anna Koulas, from the Drexel Solutions Institute, will staff this group.
