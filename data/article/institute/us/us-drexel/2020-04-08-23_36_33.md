The following message was sent to Drexel faculty and staff on March 19.

Dear Colleagues,

We are writing to you this evening on a matter of some urgency, following the order issued by Gov. Tom Wolf late this afternoon concerning the shutdown of most businesses and schools in Pennsylvania to help stem the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

As you know, we are closing the campus to the public tomorrow, Friday, March 20, at 5 pm, with only essential personnel permitted thereafter. Due to the governor’s order, we request that if there is anything you need from your campus office for your work that you pick it up in the morning and return home promptly thereafter. All faculty and professional staff should ensure they have everything they need to work remotely going forward.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely

John Fry

President

Helen Y. Bowman

Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer
