A message from Provost Donald Neiman on Graduate Student Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) and other policies for spring 2020

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,

This spring, we face an unprecedented public health crisis that has disrupted life across the globe, led universities, including Binghamton University, to move all instruction online, and created uncertainty for students and faculty who are trying to cope with dramatic, rapidly occurring changes. In response to the disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, Binghamton University’s Graduate School is adopting temporary changes to its academic policies to minimize the impact of the disruption on our graduate students.

Policy on S/U grades

For spring 2020, the Graduate School’s policy with respect to the S/U grade option is waived except for those academic programs where licensure or accreditation regulations would prohibit the waiver of this policy. Specifically, the S/U policy change DOES NOT apply to nursing; pharmacy; clinical psychology; and programs in Teaching, Learning and Educational Leadership.

All students should consult with their graduate program director to determine whether taking a course S/U will result in adverse consequences. These changes affect only Binghamton University graduate degree programs; graduate students who plan to apply to another graduate program after completing their current program should consider how the decision to select the S/U grade option may affect future applications to such programs.

Grades will be assigned normally at the end of the spring 2020 semester. After students see their grades, they will be able to change to an S/U grading option if they would like to do so. The deadline to request a change in grade option to S/U will be June 5. With the exceptions noted above, graduate students may change to an S/U grade option for any course they are currently enrolled in during the spring 2020 semester and a grade of S will fulfill progression and degree requirements accordingly. Correspondingly, S/U courses taken in spring 2020 will count toward residency and degree completion requirements.

S/U-graded courses do not count toward GPA calculation. Students who need to raise their GPA above the threshold required for graduation (i.e., 3.0) must therefore take this into account in their decision making.

Continuous Registration Policy for graduating students

For summer 2020, the Graduate School’s continuous registration policy has been modified. For students who need to be enrolled for one credit hour to complete their degrees in summer of 2020, and who therefore must maintain continuous registration, the University will absorb the cost of one credit hour of tuition upon petition. To make the request, students who are planning to complete their degrees must submit a general petition form to the Graduate School requesting tuition support for the one credit hour necessary to maintain continuous registration.

Eligibility for funding for the 2020-21 academic year

The Graduate School will waive the requirement that students have no incompletes or withdrawals on their transcript for the spring semester to remain eligible for funding in the 2020-21 academic year.

Policy on Grade Point Average (GPA)

Graduate students must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to receive their graduate degree. The GPA requirement will not be adjusted and S/U courses do not count toward GPA calculation.

Degree completion and conferral

Degree completion deadlines and degree conferral for spring 2020 will remain unchanged. Students who have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and cannot meet spring 2020 graduation deadlines may submit a general petition form to grad@binghamton.edu for a summer 2020 continuous registration waiver.

Sincerely,

Donald Nieman

Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost
