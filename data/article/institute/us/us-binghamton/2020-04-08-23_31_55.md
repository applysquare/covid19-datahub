An update about Binghamton University Commencement from President Harvey Stenger

Dear members of the Binghamton University campus community,

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, it has become clear that Binghamton University must postpone its May 2020 Commencement ceremonies until a future date, yet to be determined. This decision to cancel Commencement comes after careful consideration by students, faculty and staff.

Commencement is one of my favorite events, and I recognize the disappointment this will cause our seniors who were looking forward to the culmination of their academic career at Binghamton. I know that Commencement is a special time for the campus and especially for our seniors, and this decision is difficult for all of us.

It is my greatest hope that we will be able to hold our ceremonies at a later date. Students who are eligible to graduate will be surveyed in the near future and are encouraged to respond to help the University select a date or dates in the summer and/or fall when the campus, family and friends will be able to join in our traditional ceremonies. In the meantime, I hope that everyone will understand our reasons for postponing this yearâ€™s Commencement and will take time to reach out to congratulate and recognize our graduating seniors.

This is an extraordinary time for the campus and for all of our students. The members of the Class of 2020 will always have a special place among Binghamton University alumni. I look forward to seeing you soon for an event that you will always remember.

Sincerely,

Harvey G. Stenger

President
