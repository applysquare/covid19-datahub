Dear AU Community,

As we close another week in the ever-changing world of COVID-19, I want to share with you that all AU summer classes this year will be conducted online. Guidance from federal, state, and local governments indicates that the virus will likely still affect our communities when summer classes begin in May. Continuing our online instruction through the summer will safeguard the health and well-being of our community, provide flexibility for our students, and support our ongoing educational mission.

In this difficult time, I know many students and families are facing health and financial challenges. We are committed to supporting our AU community, and I am pleased to announce that undergraduate, graduate, and Washington College of Law (WCL) summer courses will be discounted by 10 percent this year. This discount will provide students with some financial relief and additional options for advancing their education. For a typical summer schedule of two courses (six credits), this discount translates into approximately $1,000 in savings.

Summer sessions provide our students with an opportunity to fulfill core requirements, complete major courses, or advance in graduate studies. Led by our expert faculty, summer classes deliver the robust, high-quality American University academic experience that helps our students thrive. We want to help students remain on track academically or advance more quickly towards their degree. Provost Myers, our deans, and our faculty are exploring additional classes for this summer to help meet the needs of our students, so please continue to visit the Registrar’s Schedule of Classes.

Summer registration for graduate and undergraduate students begins on Monday, April 6 and continues through June and July, depending on the start date of each session. There are no assigned registration times for summer classes. Students can check the for additional information. Summer courses will be offered under the university’s traditional grading system, and our academic advisors can help students develop a plan to help them get the most out of their summer term. Further details on summer programs are available at www.american.edu/summer.

By quickly adapting our summer classes and providing some financial relief, we want to help our students adjust as their summer plans may be disrupted by COVID-19. We know many students are facing new challenges and hardships, from canceled jobs and internships to postponed travel to the stresses of the current situation. We hope this opportunity can help alleviate some of the burden and provide new possibilities.

Thank you for your support as we continue our response to COVID-19. While the situation is difficult for all of us, please know that we are dedicated to providing the best educational opportunities for our students.

Be safe and be well.

Sylvia
