In an attempt to provide a single point of contact to report concerns about students and/or student behavior during this time, the Office of Student Development created the Care and Concern Report form.

When reports are submitted, they will be sent in a timely manner to the appropriate office/unit (such as Title IX, student conduct, the CARE team or an academic adviser). The intent is to provide an easy to complete, fairly quick way to report a concern while removing the barrier of determining which office to call or finding the appropriate form.
