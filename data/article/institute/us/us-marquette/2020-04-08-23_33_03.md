Based on newly released guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, Marquette will be issuing refunds (rather than credits) for room and board for students who were living in residence halls during the spring semester.

For students who were living in residence halls, refunds will be issued as follows:

For students who have an outstanding bursar account balance, the refund of 50% of their semester room and board costs, including meal plans, will be first applied to that balance. Any amount remaining after the balance is paid in full will be issued as a refund via direct deposit or check. Some exclusions apply; those students will be contacted separately. Students whose bursar accounts are paid in full will receive a full refund via direct deposit or check for 50% of their semester room and board costs, including meal plans. The small number of students that continue to stay in residence halls and eat on campus will not receive a refund.

For all other students who purchased a spring semester meal plan, refunds will be issued as follows:

For students who have an outstanding bursar account balance, a refund of 50% of their meal plans will be first applied to that balance. Any amount remaining after the balance is paid in full will be issued as a refund via direct deposit or check. Some exclusions apply; those students will be contacted separately. Students whose bursar accounts are paid in full will receive a full refund via direct deposit or check for 50% of their meal plan cost. The small number of students that continue to eat on campus will not receive a refund.

Students who have not already done so should sign up for direct deposit by April 15 to receive their refunds as quickly as possible, and to minimize the number of employees on campus required to print paper checks. Visit the Marquette Central website for instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through Checkmarq.

The university will issue the refunds no later than April 17 by direct deposit or mail.
