Using Microsoft Teams, the [Office of Student Educational Services](https://www.marquette.edu/oses/) is moving more than 350 currently scheduled in-person tutoring groups online. Beginning Monday, March 23, tutors will contact their tutees via email to provide instructions on how to use this new format. 

In addition, students may sign up for virtual academic coaching and study skills appointments to assist with exam prep, time management, effective online learning and more.  

Contact [Tutoring](mailto:tutoring@marquette.edu) and/or [Academic Services](mailto:academicsupport@marquette.edu) to inquire about current tutor offerings or to schedule an appointment.  

Additional remote teaching and learning resources for the Marquette community are on [the coronavirus website](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/).
