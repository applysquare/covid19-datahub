Supporting Your Virtual Student Experience

March 30, 2020

Dear Cornellians,

Last week, I shared that we were exploring ways to help students to connect while you complete the spring semester virtually. Today, I write to share some of those opportunities and other resources you may find helpful during this transition.

Virtual Campus Resources:

The Campus Activities office has created a new virtual engagement website where you can connect with student organizations, listen to Cornell Chimes and stay informed about live virtual concerts.

The Office of Engagement Initiatives is offering community-engaged learning options virtually.

Many Cornell University Library services are accessible remotely.

The Cornell Store has partnered with VitalSource and publishers to provide free access to e-books through May 25.

Personal and Professional Development:

Cornell Career Services is available to help you plan for and navigate your next steps. Virtual appointments can be made with career advisors by calling (607) 255-5296.

CUeLINKS is a great way to network with alumni virtually.

Public service can be continued virtually though programs, such as Be My Eyes, Charity Miles and School in the Cloud.

If you are interested in learning a new skill before classes start, Cornell students have free, unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning with Lynda.com, which offers thousands of training videos on graphic design, entrepreneurship, finance, personal development and much more.

Health and Well-being:

Remote physical and mental health services are available through Cornell Health.

Cornell Recreation Services is offering virtual group fitness classes, including yoga, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and Zumba.

The Cornell Botanic Gardens has created a series of videos to support mindfulness and meditation while giving viewers a glimpse of spring at Cornell.

Netflix Party lets you watch shows and movies with your family and friends remotely.

If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to prepare for online classes by testing your devices and practicing Zoom meetings with friends or family in advance. Please refer to Vice Provost Lisa Nishii’s March 22 message for information on troubleshooting, as well as other support for your academic programs.

Cornellians, just as you have throughout this year on campus, please continue to support and be kind to each other, ask for help when you need it, and provide feedback to faculty and administrators about your virtual learning experience. I must also implore you to please continue following social distancing guidelines based on your location. For those of us in New York, the governor has declared a temporary ban on all non-essential gatherings of any size, for any reason, among other social distancing measures.

This is new territory for all of us, and if we work together, we can make the best of the situation we’ve been given. I continue to send you goodwill and my very best wishes for your health and that of your loved ones.

Sincerely,

Ryan

Ryan Lombardi, Vice President for Student and Campus Life
