In the spirit of keeping you safe and informed, the University is sharing two important updates related to COVID-19 impacting the Pepperdine community.

Safer at Home Order

Pepperdine officials continue to work with local government leadership as they evaluate the ongoing response to COVID-19. This evening, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health issued the “Safer at Home Order for Control of COVID-19,” which takes effect at midnight tonight and runs through April 19, unless extended. The order advises all citizens to stay home to the greatest extent possible except for essential activities; prohibits all gatherings of 10 people or more; closes non-essential retail businesses; and reminds citizens to practice social distancing, remaining at least six feet from all others when outside the home. This order does not prohibit outdoor activities like hiking, shopping at essential businesses, or food pickup at restaurants. Questions about the order are addressed on the county’s FAQ website.

The order does not apply to colleges and universities for purposes of facilitating distance learning or performing essential functions; however, the other portions of the order, like practicing social distancing, do apply. Critical Support Personnel should continue to report to work to perform essential functions. Supervisors should use judgment to ensure the minimum number of employees are reporting to work to sustain essential University operations.

Shortly thereafter, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced statewide COVID-19 mandates, which he noted are consistent with the Los Angeles County order described above.

Pepperdine’s Emergency Operations Committee will announce additional updates to University practices tomorrow.

New COVID-19 Cases at Pepperdine

The University learned today of two additional confirmed positive COVID-19 test results within the Pepperdine community, including the first known COVID-19 case on the Malibu campus. The student did not live in University housing and is now in isolation. The second new case is a London program participant who recently returned home.

Out of an abundance of caution, Pepperdine has notified those who may have had close contact or potential exposure with the infected individuals and asked them to quarantine for 14 days and monitor their symptoms. If you have not been notified, you have not been identified to be at risk of developing symptoms.
