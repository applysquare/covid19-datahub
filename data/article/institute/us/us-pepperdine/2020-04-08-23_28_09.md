Leadership from around the University continues to evaluate the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and has begun making important decisions to most effectively serve the University’s students, faculty, and staff. Key announcements, including those shared today for Seaver College summer programs and faculty/staff wage and benefit commitments, will continue to be shared in these community updates. The University appreciates the patience of the community as it deliberates the best ways to move the University forward during this unprecedented time.

Seaver College Summer Programs

In an email to students this morning, Seaver College announced the cancelation of most international programs for summer 2020, as well as plans for academic offerings for summer sessions in Malibu. Notable changes include a new Session A during the month of May, which will be held through remote instruction, with Session I beginning in June. Sessions II and III will be combined into one session in the month of July. Seaver is currently planning to hold Sessions I, II, and III in-person in Malibu but has developed contingency plans to hold these sessions via remote instruction, if necessary. Information regarding summer programs will be regularly updated in the School-Specific FAQs for Seaver College.

Faculty/Staff Wage and Benefit Commitments

Acknowledging the essential work of our faculty and staff, President Gash announced this morning that the University will honor all currently anticipated wage and benefit commitments through the end of the University’s fiscal year on July 31, 2020. President Gash also acknowledged a renewed commitment to operational efficiency and encouraged employees to adopt practices to capture efficiencies and seek out opportunities to recognize other savings during this time. The latest information for employees, including updated guidance for how to complete time cards, has been added to the Faculty/Staff FAQs.

Over the weekend the University learned of three additional community members who reported positive test results for COVID-19. This number includes two new cases from the Seaver London cohort as well as one of a Seaver student from the Malibu campus who is now symptom free and in isolation at home.
