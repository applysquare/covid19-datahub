Rutgers is taking several measures to offer students academic support during these challenging times.

Students will be provided additional time to withdraw from courses.

Students also will have until May 22, 2020, to choose a Pass/No-credit grading option for individual courses. Pass/No-credit grades are not factored into GPAs.

If students choose a Pass/No-credit option, a note will appear on transcripts to indicate the circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak. While a Pass/No-Credit grade may impact how transcripts are viewed by employers and other universities, the impact is likely to be minimized by the fact that several universities are currently allowing this conversion.

Grading and withdrawal policies vary by campus and, sometimes, by school. Students should connect with academic advisors before deciding on grading or withdrawal options. Find more information from Rutgers-Camden, Rutgers-Newark, and Rutgers-New Brunswick.
