Dear Members of the Rutgers Community:

I am happy to announce that the 2020 Rutgers University summer session will proceed as scheduled. Because of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, instruction for all courses will be offered remotely. As you know, spring 2020 courses are being offered via remote instruction, and we will utilize that same delivery system for summer session courses.

Registration is open for summer session classes. Please direct any questions you might have about course offerings to the school or department offering the course, or to the deanâ€™s office of the school in which you are enrolled or wish to be enrolled.

Best wishes, and stay safe.

Barbara A. Lee
