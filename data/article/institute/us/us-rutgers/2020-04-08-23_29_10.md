Dear Students,

The “Stay at Home Order” signed by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has direct and indirect impacts on Rutgers University. Please be assured that Student Accounting, Billing and Cashier Services (Student ABC) is committed to supporting you as you navigate through the current situation.

In light of the evolving State and universitywide changes related to COVID-19, Student ABC will take the following steps in the coming weeks:

Housing, dining and parking charges will be credited to each eligible student’s account. The refunds will be calculated on a prorated basis beginning on March 23, the first day following Spring Break, and ending on May 16, the required move-out date at the University. We encourage students to set up direct deposit to receive their refunds faster and more securely.

Financial holds that block registration will not be placed on student accounts that have past due balances. We sympathize with families and understand the financial hardships that many families are facing during this difficult time, as well as the expectation that students focus on their academic work.
