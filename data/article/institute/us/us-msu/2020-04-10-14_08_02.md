MSU summer sports camps have been canceled

Michigan State Athletics has announced that Summer Sports Camps for summer 2020 have been canceled. Refunds will be processed for individuals who have already enrolled.

"We will miss the presence of future Spartans chasing their athletic dreams on our campus this summer, but nothing is more important than the health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and community," Michigan State athletic director Bill Beekman said.
