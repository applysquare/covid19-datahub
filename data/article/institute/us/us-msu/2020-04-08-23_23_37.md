COVID-19 health crisis impacts students who call MSU home

By:

The College of Social Science has arranged an emergency fund for students in times of crisis. Funds designated for students in this fund will support those students in the Fostering Academics, Mentoring Excellence program(or who fall into the FAME category) during disruptions that have resulted from the spread of COVID-19.

FAME is a resource for students who were in foster care, kinship care, have experienced homelessness, or are otherwise independent. The program is housed in the School of Social Work in the College of Social Science, but is open to students of all majors. Read more.
