April 7: Letter to Parents and Guardians

Dear Parents and Guardians:

These are hard times for everyone. As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.

You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.

As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.

At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.

The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.

Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.

As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.

The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.

Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.

The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.

Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts & Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.

Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling & Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.

The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.

Sincerely,

Patricia M. Lampkin

Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer

April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees

The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:

To the University community:

I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.

A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.

We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.

It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.

For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.

We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.

We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.

We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.

We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.

Jim Ryan

President

April 5: Update from the Dean of Students

Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:

I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.

I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.

If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.

• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.

• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.

• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing & Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)

This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.

• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.

• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.

• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.

Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.

New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.

We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.

Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:

• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.

• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.

With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.

I wish the best to each of you and your families.

Sincerely,

Allen W. Groves

March 30: Provost Address Governor’s Executive Order, Summer Session

To the University community,



I had planned to write to you today just about our summer programs, and information about that is below. But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.



The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”



This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.



As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.



This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at https://summer.virginia.edu/. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.



As always, please visit https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.



Sincerely,



Liz Magill

March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown

Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:

Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.

This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.

First, two reminders:

I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.

– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.

Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:

As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.

. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.

Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.

Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.

Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.

Sincerely,

Liz Magill, Provost

March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student

The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:

Dear University community:

Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.

One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.

The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.

The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.

As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.

Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.

Additional information is available from the CDC.

If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).

We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.

Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.

March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses

Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:

We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.

For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.

Several other details are important:

Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.

This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.

UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.

These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.

Best,

Liz Magill, Provost

March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity

Dear Colleagues,

I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.

In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”

We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.

Liz Magill, Provost

March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations

The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:

To the University community,

We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.

We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.

These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.

ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS

Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.

Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.

All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.

Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.

GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES

All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.

Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.

To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.

Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.

Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.

For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.

MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING

On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.

Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing & Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.

We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .

Dining

Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.

Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining

We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.

We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.

This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.

Sincerely,

Jim Ryan

March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees

Dear UVA Health Community:

To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network. These services are either subsidized or fully reimbursed. For details and directions on how to register, visit the HR Caregiving Website.

1. Bright Horizons Back-up Care

Care is provided either at a licensed care facility or in-home by care providers who have been screened, trained and background-checked. It is strongly recommended you sign up to be eligible in advance of needing care.

2. Bright Horizons Crisis Care Assist

UVA team members enrolled in the Bright Horizons Back-up Care program (above) also have the option to source their own child and/or elder care and receive reimbursement through the Crisis Care Assist program.

3. Sittercity

UVA now has a new partnership with Sittercity.com to match team members who are unable to source their own care with professional caregivers.

Call for Caregivers!

Due to high demand of caregivers needed for child/elder care, we are asking anyone who is available to provide care to please register as a caregiver in this time of need. For more details and to register, please see the HR Caregiving Website.

We understand the tremendous impact school closure is having on you and your families, therefore, we continue to explore more services to help deal with this burden.

March 17: Update on University’s Telecommuting Policy

Dear colleagues,

Yesterday Governor Northam announced that all K-12 schools in Virginia will be closed for a minimum of two weeks, beginning on Monday, March 16th. At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.

To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.

If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.

As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for child care.

Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.

We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.

Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA – every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.

Best,

Kelley Stuck

March 16: Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in University Community

The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 16:

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:

As you know from the notification received earlier today, the University has confirmed a case of COVID-19 within our community. The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.

The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:

Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours. Faculty and Staff: Contact your primary care physician via telephone or email.

Contact your primary care physician via telephone or email. If you do not have a primary care physician you may call the Virginia Department of Heath hotline at 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343).

As we work together as a community to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.

Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.

Additional information is available from the CDC.

Thank you for all you are doing during this challenging time to safeguard your own health and that of others. If you have additional questions about the University’s efforts regarding COVID-19, please contact the UVA COVID-19 Response Line at 1-877-685-4836 (domestic), +1-202-800-2408 (international), or covidinformation@virginia.edu. You can also consult the University’s Novel Coronavirus website.

Given the progression of the virus, it is not a surprise to discover a local case, but we know it will heighten anxiety. We will be in further touch to announce any additional changes we are making as the situation unfolds, and we will continue to update the website. Now, more than ever, is the time to treat each other with kindness and compassion. We are beyond grateful to everyone who has been working so hard on behalf of our community.

March 14: Academic Division Provided Details on UVA Telecommuting Policy

The following message was delivered to UVA’s Academic Division staff on March 14:

March 13: Students Urged to Return Home; UVA Can Assist With Moving Out

The following message was distributed to University of Virginia students March 13 by Dean of Students Allen Groves:

Dear Students:

Much has occurred in the past week since your Spring Break began. I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.

Now, the details:

If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.

If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.

Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.

It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.

International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.

Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.

Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.

Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.

Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.

Sincerely,

Allen W. Groves

University Dean of Students

March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home

The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:

Dear Parents and Guardians:

I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.

On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.

We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.

We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.

Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.

Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.

Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.

Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.

In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.

Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.

Sincerely,

Patricia M. Lampkin

Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer

March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes

Dear members of the UVA Community:

I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.

To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.

Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.

First, the more general updates:

We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.

We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.

Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.

Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.

for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.

The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.

Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.

Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.

We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.

We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.

We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.

Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.

This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.

If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.

Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.

***

Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.

Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.

The University is open and operating.

Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).

We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.

, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.

We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.

Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.

Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .

. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.

As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.

This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.

Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.

We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.

We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.

You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .

. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.

Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.

Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.

Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.

We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.

with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.

We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.

International Travel for University business

Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.

Domestic Travel for University business

Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed. If not, it will not be reimbursed.

Return from international travel

If you do travel internationally, it is important to note that return may be difficult. As a result of the U.S. Presidential Proclamation on March 11 th , University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s Schengen area (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the Center for Disease Control for details.

, University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the for details. University faculty and staff who are not American citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States who have been in the Schengen area in the previous 14 days may not travel to the United States, even with currently valid nonimmigrant visas, for the 30 day period beginning at midnight, March 13th. We are currently exploring whether the U.S. government may change this policy, and will share more information as we get it.

Return from personal travel

We ask all University employees to take account of this guidance as they evaluate their own personal travel. Check the state and territorial health department websites for the latest information.

Reimbursement

If you must cancel travel, seek waivers and refunds directly from the airlines and hotels first. If airlines and hotels are not issuing waivers or refunds, employees can submit expense reimbursement requests through ExpenseUVA after the date of travel.

Event restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future.

To re-emphasize, President Ryan’s message yesterday announced two policies about University-sponsored events: 1) we have suspended all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people and; 2) for events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.

Deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, or unit heads (or their designees) will apply these rules. Any leader with questions about a specific event should direct those questions to the Office of Major Events at uvaome@virginia.edu.

I want to thank all of you again for your patience and understanding. We will continue to share as much information as possible as soon as we can, and we will do our best to answer any questions that may come up. Please continue to visit the University’s Novel Coronavirus website, which is updated regularly and provides answers to many frequently asked questions.

March 11: University Moves All Courses Online, Urges Students to Return Home

To the University community,

I write to share an update on our response to the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, and our plans for the remainder of the Spring semester.

To begin with the basic and important news:

We will be moving our classes online. We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.

We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.

Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.

Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .

. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.

These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.

After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.

Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.

To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.

A few notes for specific groups:

Students

If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.

. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .

This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.

whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.

With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.

Faculty

All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.

We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.

While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.

Staff

For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .

. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.

Events

Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.

For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.

At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.

We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.

I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.

I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.

I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.

We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.

Best,

Jim

March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations

The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.

Dear members of the University community:

Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.

There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.

Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:

International Travel

University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.

Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.

International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.

If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.

Domestic Travel

At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.

These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.

While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.

Spring Break and Beyond

Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.

We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.

This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.

For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.

Sincerely,

Jim Ryan

President

March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel

The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.

Dear members of the UVA community:

Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.

Spring Break Study Abroad

The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.

Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.

We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.

Travel Guidance

The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.

We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.

If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.

We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.

We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.

The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.

Sincerely,

Liz Magill, Provost

Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill

The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.

Dear colleagues:

Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.

UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.

We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort and advise our students in this way; at the same time, we realize that this responsibility may feel overwhelming. In addition to using the resources above, students can reach counselors at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 434-243-5150, 24 hours a day. The International Studies Office (ISO) is also available to assist students who are studying here from abroad, and we have support resources available for faculty and staff through the Faculty & Employee Assistance Program.

As we continue to contend with the coronavirus, please know that we are thinking of you and your families, friends, and colleagues, and we are committed to providing the support you need during this difficult time.

Warmly,

Liz Magill, Provost

Feb. 26: Update on Coronavirus for UVA Students

The following message to University students was delivered Feb. 26:

Important Reminders: Spring Break Health and Safety

To: All Students

From: Allen W. Groves, University Dean of Students

odos@virginia.edu

Dear Students:

Since many of you soon will be leaving Charlottesville for Spring Break, I am writing with several important reminders about health and safety.

If you follow the news, you already know the global coronavirus outbreak is a major concern for anyone considering international travel at this time. The virus has spread to areas of the world beyond China with an accelerating and unpredictable trajectory. This threat will likely grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that the virus is expected to impact the United States in a more severe way than it has to date.

Traveling abroad – whether for study or leisure – carries a number of potential risks. Even a country not currently experiencing an outbreak could suddenly be declared a high-risk area, resulting in heightened exposure to the virus, difficulty with departure, immigration barriers in returning to the U.S., and even possible restrictions on returning to Grounds. The University strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher. While we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the University will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4.

The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:

Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water.

Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.

Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.

Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.

TRAVEL PREPARATION

The CDC maintains a travel information website for coronavirus (COVID-19).
