4/7: Important COVID-19 advisory - Governors Complex

The following letter was emailed to residents of UB's Governors Complex residence hall on April 6:

We are reaching out with health update for our student community. A resident of the Governors Complex is currently in quarantine with a presumptive case of COVID-19. This individual is experiencing mild symptoms and will not be tested at this time.

UB’s Health Services staff are providing support to this individual and they are also receiving the resources necessary to be able to make a full recovery. The individual’s roommate, who currently has no COVID-19 symptoms, has been relocated and is in precautionary quarantine. Both students have been given instructions by the university to remain in their rooms and the delivery of food has been arranged.

Based on the timing of the individual’s illness and the reduced number of people in the complex, we believe that there was limited exposure to others. Please know that the health and safety of our residents is of utmost importance to Campus Living and that we are collaborating with everyone to reduce the risk of spread to others. This includes directly contacting and providing guidance to anyone identified as having close contact with this individual.

Additionally, all members of the Governors community should be mindful of the need to self-monitor their health closely for the next 14 days. It is recommended that you check your temperature twice daily and monitor for cough and/or shortness of breath.

If you develop a temperature of 100.4° F or higher that is accompanied by a cough or shortness of breath, you should self-isolate and immediately and notify your health care provider or UB Health Services at 716-829-3316.

As health officials continue to monitor the community spread of COVID-19 in Western New York, we expecting to see an increase in the number of cases (presumptive or confirmed) within the university community. Please be assured that Campus Living is committed to keeping you updated about this evolving situation. In addition to regularly checking your email, please visit UB’s COVID-19 website.

Please remember that the leadership within Campus Living stands ready to help and support you, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with questions. Please feel free to reach out via email to Julie Szrama (juliemos@buffalo.edu) if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your understanding and resilience as we face these trying times together.

Sincerely,

Julie Szrama

Complex Coordinator
