A Message from President Satish K. Tripathi

Out of concern for the health and safety of our campus community, the University at Buffalo’s May 2020 commencement ceremonies will not take place as scheduled. Plans to reschedule graduation celebrations are currently being developed. We will update our graduates and our entire campus community as soon as possible.

While we know this is disappointing news to UB’s Class of 2020 as well their families, friends and our university community, this is a necessary decision given the unprecedented circumstances we face. As we look forward to celebrating our 2020 graduates in a manner befitting their accomplishments, I thank you for your continued patience and understanding.
