COVID Fee Credit Adjustments and Refunds

As a result of COVID-19, the following adjustments were made to student accounts for the spring 2020 semester. These adjustments reflect credits of eligible Course Fees (e.g., lab fees), housing, dining, Comprehensive Fee and Student Activity Fees.

About COVID Refunds and Credits

Student Accounts has worked with fee stewards across the university to determine credits due to students for the spring 2020 semester as a result of COVID-19.

Students have received prorated credits for certain fees where services have been discontinued or curtailed due to the COVID-19 emergency. A calculated credit amount has been determined for each of these fees.

After credits are applied to the student’s account, a refund will be granted where applicable.

Students anticipating a refund are encouraged to enroll in direct deposit. Funds should be available in student bank accounts within 2 business days from the time the direct deposit refund is initiated, depending on your financial institution. Direct deposit refunds will be processed the week of May 4, 2020.

For students without a direct deposit profile, refunds will be mailed by check to the student’s permanent address the week of May 11, 2020.
