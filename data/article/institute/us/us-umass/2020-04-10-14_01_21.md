Dear Zoom User:

The transition to online teaching and learning, and remote work in general, has highlighted new cybersecurity challenges and concerns. Among them, the need for campus communities to protect online spaces against hackers, disruptors, and others with malicious intentions.

This is not a UMass-specific problem. Virtual classrooms, meetings, and spaces worldwide are at risk of increased disruptions, such as Zoombombing. We are monitoring these issues and working to achieve a balance between safety and ease of use for Zoom as we respond to rapidly evolving opportunities and challenges. A few updates are available below.

Changes to UMass Amherst Zoom Default Settings

To prevent potential disruptions, UMass Amherst’s default settings for Zoom meetings now include the following:

“Join Before Host” is disabled - No one can join the session before the host is there.



“Allow Removed Participants to Re-join” is disabled - Individuals who have been kicked out of a session cannot slip back in.



“Co-Host” is enabled - You can assign others to help moderate Zoom sessions.



“File Transfer” is disabled - Malicious files cannot be distributed.



“Annotation” is disabled - Participants cannot use annotation tools to add information to shared screens. You can re-enable this option if necessary.
