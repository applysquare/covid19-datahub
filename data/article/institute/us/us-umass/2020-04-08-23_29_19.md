Governor Charlie Baker has extended until May 4 his emergency order requiring all businesses and organizations that do not provide “COVID-19 Essential Services” to close their physical workplaces and facilities to workers, customers and the public. The university’s previously announced policy that “only onsite personnel should report to campus, unless contacted by a supervisor,” remains in accordance with the Governor’s extended order. The order also extends the prohibition on gatherings of more than 10 people until May 4.

Per the Governor’s order, included on the list of designated essential services are: educators and staff supporting emergency childcare programs and residential schools for students with severe disabilities, and public and private K-12 schools, colleges, and universities for purposes of facilitating distance learning, provision of school meals and other essential student support functions, and essential administrative functions necessary to maintain continuity of operations. The order also includes scientific researchers in higher education completing in-process research to ensure health and safety and to prevent the loss of essential data

The stay at home advisory issued by the Department of Public Health outlining self-isolation and social distancing protocols will also remain in effect until further notice. Massachusetts residents are advised to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel and other unnecessary activities during this period. Residents over 70 years of age or with underlying health conditions, who are considered at high risk when exposed to COVID-19, should limit social interactions with other people as much as possible.

In relation to the Governor’s order, the university has also implemented and continues to maintain minimum on-site research and personnel plans for laboratory research continuity.
