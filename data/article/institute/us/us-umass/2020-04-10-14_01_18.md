In light of the current state and federal restrictions and guidelines regarding gatherings and events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the university has made the difficult decision to suspend, cancel or convert to virtual much of its spring and summer programming. Decisions regarding many major university programs and events are noted below.

Academic Affairs

Currently, Admissions has cancelled its admitted student days for later this month and will move this event online. Campus information sessions and tours have been cancelled through May 4 in adherence with restrictions announced by Governor Baker, and Admissions is beginning online groups to replace these events. A number of events in Boston, Newton and Springfield for new and transfer students scheduled for this spring have been canceled. Admissions plans no large in-person group events until late September.

For prospective students who are applying for admission in Fall 2021, there will be virtual information sessions happening and a virtual experience for admitted first-year students that can be accessed at www.umass.edu/admissions/virtual-experience-admitted-students.

All classes being held by UMass Amherst this summer will be online. For more information or to enroll, visit www.umass.edu/online/summersession. Accordingly, all summer face-to-face courses, offered through the University Without Walls in Amherst and Newton, are canceled.

The April Preparing for Finals workshops, part of the Success Toolkit series, have been moved to a Zoom meeting format.

The Cash Cab event scheduled for the spring has been canceled, but the Smart About Money peer financial coaches are offering individual financial-education sessions remotely.

Alumni Relations

Alumni Relations has postponed, canceled or reformatted its in-person events to virtual events until at least sometime in July. Updated information on events can be found at www.umassalumni.com.

Athletics

The annual SAMYS Awards in-person event honoring student-athletes and their achievements has been converted to a digital event that will take place across Athletics social media platforms on April. 27.

All summer camps and clinics, as well as golf tournaments, are subject to change.

Conference Services

Conference services has cancelled all events through May 31. All events scheduled for June through August are subject to change. More information will be provided on or about May 4.

Career Services

Human Resources

The Chancellor’s Citation Awards honoring outstanding employees, usually presented in May, have been canceled, as has the length of services awards and the Gerald Scanlon Student Employee Awards.

Mullins Center

All events are canceled through the end of May. Plans for summer events remain uncertain.

On April 23, Student Engagement and the Black Mass Communication Project (BMCP) will host an eSports competition. On April 25, BMCP will host a SoulFest DJ Party via its Instagram feed (@umassbmcp) from noon to 5 p.m.
