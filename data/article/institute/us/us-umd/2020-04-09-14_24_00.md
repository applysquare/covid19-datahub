# Suspending UMD Education Abroad programs for spring 2020 in all locations

**March 14, 2020**

Dear University of Maryland community,

With the announcement of further travel restrictions and university closings in UMD study abroad locations around the world, I am today suspending all UMD Education Abroad programs for spring 2020 in all locations immediately and requiring all students to return to their home of record as soon as possible.

I want to emphasize that we have reached the decision out of deep and growing concern for the health and safety of our students. We are requiring students to act immediately and cooperate with the Education Abroad staff to come home as soon as possible to avoid additional health risks, further unanticipated travel restrictions, and other serious problems.

We are following up separately with students and their emergency contacts to provide resources and additional guidance.

I again urge everyone to take seriously prevention measures and stay informed by visiting [umd.edu/virusinfo](/umd.edu/virusinfo).

Sincerely,

**Mary Ann Rankin**  
 _Senior Vice President and Provost_
