Dear Students:

As we manage the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presents for our spring semester activities, we are turning now to summer planning. While we continue to work through all aspects of summer programs, including conferences, camps and other activities, we want to communicate that our undergraduate and graduate Summer 2020 course offerings will be moved to virtual delivery. We will provide additional updates in the days and weeks ahead.

Summary

All summer academic offerings will use remote delivery platforms;

In addition to what is already scheduled, we are planning additional courses for the summer schedule for undergraduate and graduate students, and will communicate these to you in the near future;

Summer study abroad programs have been suspended;

We are reviewing how the current situation will affect international students, military connected students and scholarship recipients.

Details

We are now engaged in coordinated and creative planning to shift as many programs and courses as possible into remote learning environments. This will allow you to continue to stay engaged academically and make progress toward your degrees through instructional continuity. For Main Campus programs scheduled between May and August, schools will transition courses and programs into a virtual delivery format. For all questions about the transition to instructional continuity for summer programs, please consult your academic advisor or dean.

Summer study abroad programs have also been suspended. While nothing can fully replicate the residential, intercultural and experiential nature of a study abroad experience, Georgetown is committed to developing alternative academic opportunities for students whose summer plans have been impacted by COVID-19.

We want to expand offerings in ways that are responsive to the interests of students in all of the schools. Please look for communications in the near future for more information on expanded summer offerings.

Finally, please know we are seeking clarification about federal policies that affect international students, military connected students and scholarship recipients. We will provide guidance to these students as soon as various policies have been clarified.

This decision was made after careful deliberation, with your health and wellbeing as our highest priority. We look forward to working with you to ensure your summer academic experience is meaningful and engaging.

Sincerely,

Robert M. Groves
