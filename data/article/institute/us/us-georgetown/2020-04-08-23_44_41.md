Dear Members of the Georgetown Community:

In line with District and federal guidance and university guidelines related to social distancing, the Georgetown University Library will no longer offer physical access effective Tuesday, March 24. This includes access to Lauinger, Dahlgren Memorial and the Bioethics, Blommer, Woodstock and the School of Continuing Studies branch libraries. These locations will continue to offer a full set of online services and access to online collections.

Continuing services will include access to online materials, reference, class or research consultations and assistance with securing expanded online access to curriculum-based and/or research materials, as possible. Please visit the library website for a complete set of services available virtually. If you have any issues with access, please visit the Off-Campus Access page for tips and assistance.

All library materials currently checked-out will be automatically renewed, with an unlimited number of automatic renewals to be applied until further notice.

As the university adapts to this complex and evolving public health crisis, the Georgetown University Library will continue to be a source of knowledge and transformational learning.

Sincerely,

Robert M. Groves

Provost

Geoff Chatas

Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Harriette Hemmasi
