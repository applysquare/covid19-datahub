We continue to move forward with an abundance of care and concern for the health and safety of our students, faculty, professionals and community.  To that end, we are closely monitoring the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and are deeply thankful to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Office of Emergency Management for their constant contact and guidance. 

To our knowledge, we have not had any new, confirmed positive tests for COVID-19 in our student, faculty and administrative bodies. It was announced in Israel that Rabbi Dov Zinger who was a guest speaker on our uptown campus on February 25th has tested positive. At this point, many of us know people who have tested positive. Please keep Rav Zinger and all those infected with this virus in your tefillot.

**Academic Classes**

We have already cancelled all in-person classes for this week. As a precautionary measure, we are moving all undergraduate and graduate classes at Yeshiva University online starting March 16 through April 3, which marks the beginning of our Passover recess. Our online learning platform will utilize Zoom and Canvas. Each student will be receiving a detailed email with further instructions.
