Dear YU Community,

Over the last two days, two additional students were tested and the results have come back negative. Additionally, an undergraduate adjunct professor has tested positive but he has not been on the YU campus for the last three weeks.

Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation, and we encourage you to consult your health professional for any individual questions.

In respect to the universityâ€™s classes, with an abundance of caution, we have decided to take the following steps:

-Undergraduate academic classes on both the Beren and Wilf campuses will be cancelled throughout this week, and will resume on Monday, March 16. In the event of further cancellations, we are preparing for the contingency of online classes.

-Graduate classes in Azrieli, Katz, Revel, RIETS, Syms and Wurzweiler will resume remotely on Wednesday, March 11, either asynchronously or through a live online format. Students should be in touch with their faculty and advisors for more details.

\- Ferkauf and Cardozo will continue to offer regularly scheduled face to face classes. ** **

I will continue to keep you informed with more updates as they become available.
