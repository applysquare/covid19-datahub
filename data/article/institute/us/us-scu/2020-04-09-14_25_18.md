The  **spring quarter  start and end dates** have not changed: the quarter will run March 30 - June 5 with the final exam period June 8 - June 11.

We have designated the period from  **March 30 - April 7 as Instructional Preparation time** , a period during which faculty and undergraduates will make preparations to engage in a high-quality, personalized educational experience in the Jesuit tradition, when  **individual classes resume fully online on April 8 for undergraduates.**

_**What students will do during Instructional Preparation time**_

During the  **Instructional Preparation**  period, all undergraduate students will be  _automatically enrolled in_  and encouraged to complete a  **stand-alone Camino Mini-Course, “Learning to Learn Online,”**  which provides suggestions for students on how best to adapt to the virtual/remote learning environment, information about SCU student resources for academic, personal, and career support, and an invitation to engage in virtual discussion with their peers about various topics including sustainability, well-being and ethics. Students may also be asked to engage in educational activities such as reviewing course expectations, reading assigned texts, completing assigned work, working on problem sets, watching videos, setting up their technology, and preparing other necessary supplies. Students will need to regularly monitor communications from their professors.
