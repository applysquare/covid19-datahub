The following message was emailed to the campus community on March 26, 2020.

Dear Santa Clara University community,

As we conclude the week, we would like to express immense gratitude to everyone at Santa Clara. These past few weeks have been tumultuous and very busy as we assisted students in move-out and continue to manage the ongoing transition to remote learning. We truly appreciate everyone coming together as our community does its part to stop the spread of the virus and comply with the California shelter-in-place restrictions. Please read below for our weekly roundup of updates in various areas:

**Clarification on Start of the Term:** The spring quarter start and end dates have not changed: The quarter will run March 30–June 5 with the final exam period June 8–June 11.  The University has designated the period from March 30–April 7 as Instructional Preparation time—a period during which faculty and undergraduates will make preparations to engage in a high-quality, personalized educational experience in the Jesuit tradition before individual classes resume fully online on April 8 for undergraduates. View more [information and calendar details here](https://www.scu.edu/covid-19/information-for-students/). Students, please regularly check your email for communication from your professors. 

At the graduate level, instructional activities from March 30–April 7 will vary by School. Please consult with your graduate program for additional information.

**Spring Tuition Update:** The University will continue to charge its published rates for the current semester or quarter. While our mode of delivery has changed temporarily, our fundamental commitment and investment in a holistic, transformational, Jesuit educational experience remain. These commitments are funded by tuition revenue, and even in ordinary years, tuition does not cover the full cost of education.  Our exceptional faculty will deliver their courses through digital platforms and virtual learning environments in a way that preserves excellence in the educational and formational experience to our students, including smaller class sizes. Moreover, as indicated below, students will continue to be served through various offices on campus, including Drahmann Advising Center, Center for Student Involvement, Campus Ministry, the Career Center, and Counseling and Psychological Services.
