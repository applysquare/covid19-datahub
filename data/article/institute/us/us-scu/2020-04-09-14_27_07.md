SCU undergraduate and graduate students experiencing IMMEDIATE financial need as a result of recent COVID-19 events can apply for assistance via the Emergency Assistance Fund Request Survey on the [Financial Aid website](https://www.scu.edu/financialaid/).

These applications will be reviewed by Financial Aid, which will respond to your request in a timely manner. Given the current circumstances, they will be as generous as possible with funds. Please be honest with your requests in order to ensure they are able to properly allocate funds for as many students as possible.

Those seeking assistance for greater needs may fill out the 2019-2020 Appeal Request Form on the [Financial Aid website](https://www.scu.edu/financialaid/).
