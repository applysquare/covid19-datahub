To: BOSP Spring Quarter Participants and Emergency Contacts

In response to the rapidly evolving events surrounding COVID-19 and out of concern for the health and safety of our community, Stanford University is suspending all BOSP spring quarter programs scheduled to take place outside of the United States. This will affect 234 undergraduates currently planning to study abroad in eight international locations.

This decision follows the recent recommendation made by the University for all members of the community to reconsider any international travel plans. In addition to the spread of the virus itself, students may face unpredictable circumstances overseas during the spring quarter, including accessing health care while abroad, navigating disruptions to local services, and the potential for travel interruptions or restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has also issued guidance this week for institutes of higher education to consider suspending or postponing study abroad programs.

On-site instruction in BOSP Florence was suspended last week due to a surge in COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and an abundance of caution on the part of Stanford. Based on current intelligence, there are no plans to end other winter quarter programs early. BOSP continues to monitor guidance daily from the CDC, the U.S. Department of State, the World Health Organization, Stanford’s Public Health Policy Committee, as well as communicating regularly with on-site staff and consulting with peer institutions.

Stanford remains deeply committed to global education and the mission of BOSP. We intend to resume our programs as soon as we are able.

Below you’ll find FAQs that were created to help you navigate next steps including academic planning for spring quarter, making changes to travel arrangements, available housing on campus, and more. Our BOSP staff are prepared to support and assist you throughout this process.

What about housing for spring quarter?

All students who apply for spring quarter housing will be offered a housing assignment.

Students who currently live in student housing on the main Stanford campus, who will no longer be going overseas, may remain in their current room assignments. To do so, please submit a Services & Support ticket to request to rescind your termination for Spring Quarter. Your deadline to submit this help ticket is 5pm on Friday, March 6. If you submit your help ticket by the deadline, you will not have to change housing assignments for spring quarter.

Students with housing related questions can submit a help ticket for assistance or call the Housing Assignment office at 650-725-2810.

Who can I speak with about academic concerns, including my Spring Quarter course registration on campus?

All Spring quarter BOSP classes will be cancelled by the Office of the University Registrar by the end of day Friday, March 6, 2020, and as a result, previously enrolled students will be dropped from these classes. Please log in to Axess to adjust your Spring study list.

If you have questions or concerns about registering for classes for the spring quarter, please get in touch with your Academic Advisor (AAD or AARC advisor). To book an appointment with either your AAD or AARC Advisor please visit: https://undergrad.stanford.edu/advising/make-appointment.

What should I do about my plane ticket? Will Stanford reimburse me?

BOSP will reimburse airline change fees upon presentation of documentation and receipts. Many airlines are adjusting their policies due to the COVID-19 outbreak and this may impact your airline ticket. BOSP strongly suggests that you call (not attempt to do online) the issuer of your plane ticket, whether issued directly by an airline or by a travel agent, and inquire about any waivers or refunds that may apply to the specific ticket you purchased. You may also be assessed a “fare difference”; BOSP will not reimburse any “fare difference.”

This should be done as soon as possible and must be completed before your currently scheduled departure date.

Documentation and receipts may be submitted to BOSP at: https://forms.gle/msXWLur2tC35zpVN7

Please address any flight reimbursement concerns to bospsupport@stanford.edu

How will my University Bill be affected?

BOSP has taken action to update your student account to reflect the suspension of the program. The Financial Aid Office and Student Financial Services have been notified of your change in status and your University Bill has been updated. Your financial aid award will be revised this week to reflect your aid prior to the overseas adjustment. If you have specific questions about how your financial aid has been impacted, please contact the Financial Aid Office directly.

Your University account will be updated with any changes to your tuition and fees. Please allow time for these changes to be reflected on your account. If you have questions in regards to your University bill please contact the Student Services Center https://studentservicescenter.stanford.edu/contact-us.

How can I learn about future BOSP study away opportunities?

BOSP is committed to helping students participate in a future study away program. To inquire about participation, we encourage you to reach out to a BOSP Program Advisor for more information about your program or programs of interest. You can schedule a meeting with a BOSP advisor on our website, email us at bospstudy@lists.stanford.edu, or call our office's main phone line at (650) 723-3558.
