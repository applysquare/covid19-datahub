From Melissa Sturge-Apple, Vice Provost and University Dean of Graduate Education:

COVID-19 has had a significant impact upon the educational system across the United States and across the world. The University of Rochester also understands that the pandemic has had a reverberating effect on the daily lives of every student.

On behalf of those in charge of graduate admissions at Rochester, across schools and programs, I want to assure you that we recognize this impact and also understand that colleges and universities across the globe are implementing various grading policies this term that may affect prospective studentsâ€™ cumulative GPAs. All of these factors will be considered in evaluating applications.

We encourage prospective students to include in their personal statements special circumstances as well as achievements that may not be apparent due to modified grading policies.

For more detailed information, please do not hesitate to contact the school or program to which you plan to apply. We appreciate your interest in the University of Rochester and remain committed to attracting the most talented students, regardless of the circumstances they face. We wish you best of luck with your studies this term and with your application to Rochester.
