Dear Faculty,

Information Technology Services (ITS) is committed to providing you with the tools and services you need to successfully deliver your classes on-line. This includes a safe, protected, inclusive, on-line learning environment for our faculty and students.  As such, there are safeguards in Zoom that we instituted to  **proactively address**  the class breaches experienced this week as well as Zoom features that can be leveraged to manage participants  **during class**.  These are as follows:​

**On-Line Waiting Room​**

  * We enabled the Waiting Room feature for all classes and meetings conducted via Zoom.​
  * Any participant who does not login using their USC Zoom credentials automatically will be placed in the Waiting Room and will be presented with the following [message](https://keepteaching.usc.edu/waiting-room-message-2/).​
  * This will allow the Meeting Host to determine who to admit in class from the [Waiting Room](https://keepteaching.usc.edu/waiting-room-add-or-remove-participants/).​
  * Note: The Meeting Host will need to monitor the Waiting Room throughout the meeting to admit those that did not authenticate with their USC Zoom credentials.​



**Class Management**  ​

In the event that you encounter a disruptive participant during class, we recommend that you:​

  * [Remove](https://keepteaching.usc.edu/remove-participants-from-class/) participant from the class.​
  * Use the [Lock](https://keepteaching.usc.edu/lock-a-meeting/) feature to keep participant out of the class altogether.​



While these are strong preventative measures, additional development is underway to further tighten up the access to our on-line learning environment and classes.  Please let us know how ITS can make this transition smoother and to support you as you continue your teaching on-line. ​​

Best regards,​ ​
