Plans for Summer 2020 Course Offerings

March 26, 2020, 10:00 a.m. CDT

Dear Students:

We made the decision this week that all courses in the first summer term, the 10-week summer term, and the May “minimester” will be delivered online. In an effort to help students, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level. For distance education degree programs with a program fee, there is no change in how they will be charged.

At this time, we are planning for traditional, face-to-face delivery in the second summer term with a back-up plan for online delivery depending on the length of the current situation. We will communicate final plans for the second summer session early enough for individuals to plan accordingly.

Additionally, we are working to ensure we have a robust variety of summer coursework needed to make progress toward your degree.

Registration begins March 30 and will continue as scheduled.

As a reminder, please consult the central Texas A&M University page for regular updates as well as keeplearning.tamu.edu.
