Dear Students,

I would like to welcome everyone resuming classes at Texas A&M this week in a “new normal” online. Given the recent shelter in place at residence order from Brazos, Galveston and other counties impacting our campuses and sites, I also want to thank you for your tremendous patience and understanding during this challenging time.

I was honored to be invited to join yesterday’s Facebook Live Virtual Town Hall Meeting hosted by Student body President Mikey Jaillet and Student body President-elect Eric Mendoza. Other senior university leaders and myself appreciated the engagement and opportunity to address what is on your minds as we were “social distanced” across multiple studios at KAMU and another building!

As we continue to respond to new updates, I want to assure you that our top priority is your health and safety. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our faculty and staff, we have made major adjustments to bring everything online, greatly reducing the risk you face during this historic pandemic. For those who needed to return to our campuses, we have taken extensive measures to ensure your safety, with some buildings offering monitors to promote social distancing and all of our facilities providing enhanced procedures to promote public health.

As new developments emerge, please visit the TAMU Central COVID-19 Website for coronavirus-related updates across a wide range of relevant topics.

Campus remains open, but with classes moving online many of you have decided to stay home. To that end, all of our academic and support services are, to the extent possible, available virtually. I encourage you to visit the Keep Learning site for ongoing updates.

For those of you who have decided to stay on campus, we will continue to provide essential services such as grab-and-go dining. Bus transportation will be available on campus, with limited passengers to ensure social distancing. Campus ATMs remain in operation. Please consult the central site or the Keep Learning site for building hours, as some academic buildings will remain accessible only for those who have key card access and will close by 5:00 p.m.

Yesterday we were delighted to announce credits or refunds for on-campus housing, dining and parking for those who will no longer use these services this spring.

While online classes have gone well so far, please understand that everything will not be perfect. During this unprecedented moment in our nation’s history, our faculty and staff have made enormous efforts to continue your education. However, there may still be logistical challenges that arise, and we may need to make changes to enhance your experience.

As we get through this together, I want to assure you that Aggies will continue to learn and graduate from Texas A&M, moving on to engage in extraordinary acts of service to our state, our nation and world just as they have for more than 140 years.

Thank you for your patience and understanding, and for making us all proud to say you are students at Texas A&M.

Sincerely,

Michael K. Young

President
