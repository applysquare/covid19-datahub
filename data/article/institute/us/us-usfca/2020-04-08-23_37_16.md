First and foremost, thank you. Thank you for the patience and grace you all have shown as we come together as a community, albeit remotely, and move forward together.

Dear Students,



First and foremost, thank you. Thank you for the patience and grace you all have shown as we come together as a community, albeit remotely, and move forward together. I know this is not the semester you were planning nor hoping for and I want to assure you that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to ensure that you continue to have an engaging and transformative USF experience. While we may not be together in the traditional sense, the USF mission and values that we all embrace — to be in service with and for one another and our communities — are more important than ever and will continue to connect and inspire us during this challenging time.



Below you’ll find details about how you can continue to access comprehensive student services, which are central to the personalized, distinctive education that USF provides. As of today there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in our community, but in keeping with public health orders we are changing operations and implementing social distancing in how we deliver student services to control the spread of the virus. All of the information below will also be posted on the myUSF resource page, and we will continue to update you with additional information about the host of support and resources available to ensure your success.



Thank you,

Julie Orio

Vice President of Student Life

Koret

While the Koret Health and Recreation Center is closed at this time per county health orders, USF’s Recreational Sports Department continues to offer USF students sports activities, wellness programs, and fitness resources to encourage sportsmanship, teamwork, physical fitness, and resilience. The department strives to help students build communities of support, develop leadership skills and increase engagement during this change in the USF experience.



Coaches will utilize technology in order to maintain team connection for club sports participants. Instructors will develop content to keep students engaged in self-care and a healthy routine. Trainers will move to new forms of coaching using Zoom and other technologies to continue to develop fitness programs that students can do at home with minimal or no equipment. Outdoor Adventures staff will provide suggestions for outdoor activities that can help students unplug, in compliance with shelter in place recommendations.

Student Employment

As we prepare to modify campus operations and execute plans for remote operations and support reduced residential operations, USF’s goal is to provide our student employees with remote work opportunities that will continue to engage them and provide the financial assistance they depend on.

Student employees and their supervisors should work together to create remote working plans where possible. Supervisors will also identify additional areas or tasks that may present opportunities for another student employee who may not be eligible for a remote working arrangement due to the nature of their job. Supervisors may contact Student Employment for support. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring appropriate remote working plans are in place, including agreed upon tasks, substantiation of their student employees work, and virtual check-ins throughout the semester. Additional details, further instructions, and resources will be communicated to student employee supervisors and budget managers soon.

Please contact Student Employment at stuemp@usfca.edu or (415) 422-6770 with questions. Voicemails will be reviewed multiple times a day.

Student Housing and Residential Education (SHaRE)

Students with general concerns and questions can email share@usfca.edu or call (415) 422-6824. If you are staying on campus you can go to your hall front desk during posted working hours or use the after-hours call line. Residence directors and assistant residence directors are working remotely and can be reached by phone and email. For off-campus support, contact usfcaoffcampus@usfca.edu.

Student Leadership and Engagement (SLE)

SLE is continuing to support student organizations and leadership programs in this virtual environment. Staff are available by email at sle@usfca.edu and we will continue to reach students through our weekly newsletter and on Instagram. Nominations for Student Organization Awards and Student Leadership Awards are still being accepted with an extended deadline.

University Ministry (UM)
