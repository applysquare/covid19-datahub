Clemson University officials continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and are actively engaged in daily planning in an effort to inform and reduce the risk to faculty, staff, students and visitors from the virus.

As of today, March 18, at 5 p.m., the University can confirm the following:

No confirmed cases at any Clemson campus or facility.

Zero cases at Clemson campuses or facilities being monitored.

Online instruction has been implemented following spring break, through at least Sunday, April 5. In addition, no programs, events or activities will be held through the same timeframe.

All students, faculty and staff returning from international travel must contact University health services (864-656-2457) to undergo thorough medical screening.

ON-CAMPUS HOUSING UPDATE

Clemson student residents were notified earlier this week of the University’s housing modifications. All requests to remain in student housing due to extenuating circumstances were due today by 5 p.m., March 18. We received more than 1,000 requests, and nearly all have received a decision on the status of their request.

Access to all residence halls and apartments to all who do not have an approved request will be restricted beginning on Thursday, March 19 at 5 p.m.

EMPLOYEE SUPPORT INFORMATION

CCIT has developed guides for our students, faculty, and staff as a primer for technologies to help you succeed while working remotely. This page provides an introduction to relevant technologies, explains why they are important, and provides resources for getting started with each.

The Office of Human Resources has also developed this page to assist supervisors in implementing remote work.

ACADEMIC SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

As we prepare for online instruction to begin next week, many of our faculty have been working this week to ensure the transition from in-person instruction to online delivery is as seamless as possible. Faculty can find resources for online instruction on the academic continuity page, and Clemson Online will continue to host virtual drop-ins via a virtual meeting space throughout the week of spring break for assistance, information or training as faculty prepares for the transition. Join us virtually anytime from 8:30 a.m. through 4 p.m. through Friday, March 20. If you have technical issues, please reach out to CCIT support at IThelp@clemson.edu.

RESEARCH OPERATIONS

The modified operations of the University have brought about several questions about research work at Clemson. We have attempted to answer those questions as best as possible with the current information available on our COVID-19 Research Continuity webpage found on the Clemson COVID website. As the situation continues to evolve, the page will be updated as new information becomes available.
