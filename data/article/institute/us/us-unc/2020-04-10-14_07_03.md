Dear Carolina community,

As the University continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, based on guidance provided by the UNC System Office, we are reaching out to update you regarding Summer School. In order to continue to mitigate the spread of the virus and keep our campus safe, we have determined that all summer 2020 courses (Maymester, Summer I and Summer II) will be delivered only through remote instruction. To allow greater opportunity for students to progress to degree, we will allow them to enroll in 9 credits in Summer I and 9 credits in Summer II, without requiring approval from their dean.

Please note that the College of Arts & Sciences will suspend the regular “no pass/fail” Summer School grading policy and will extend the Spring 2020 Emergency Grading Accommodation through the Summer 2020 terms. The deans of the graduate and professional schools will continue to have full discretion and oversight of courses in their schools or under their purview, including programs with undergraduate students, to make decisions regarding pass/fail.

Making the decision to transition summer courses to remote instruction will help professors get ahead on developing effective remote learning strategies and maximizing their pedagogical impact. Instructors will find many resources at keepteaching.unc.edu, including the opportunity for one-on-one consultation with a member of the Keep Teaching instructional design support team.

We thank our faculty and staff for helping in the effort to keep students on track despite the academic disruptions caused by COVID-19. More than 1,650 undergraduates have been impacted by the cancellation of UNC-Chapel Hill’s spring and summer academic programs abroad. Many graduate students have had to alter their plans as well. We are determining what additional courses may be needed. Our preference is to maintain all current summer 2020 course offerings to preserve the widest range of academic options possible. We will be following up with some department chairs and instructors individually to fill gaps and possibly add courses in specific disciplines.

We recognize that these are uncertain times and look to summer with great hope for a reprieve from these unprecedented circumstances. With a strategy in place that provides students with the academic options that they need, we will help them rebound and earn their degrees.

Sincerely,

Robert A. Blouin

Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost

Sherry Salyer

Interim Dean of the Summer School
