Dear students,

As you may be aware, the U.S. Department of State on March 12 issued a Global Level 3 Travel Health Advisory and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 11 issued an Alert – Level 2 outbreak notice due to the global impact of COVID-19. Their guidance urges Americans to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19. In light of these upgraded warnings and the University’s prohibition of travel outside of North Carolina, all summer 2020 study abroad and international education programs are canceled. This decision includes undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.

We know this presents a significant disruption, and that you have been looking forward to an exciting, challenging and rewarding experience abroad for many months, if not years. Making this difficult decision now provides students with a timeframe to make alternative plans for the summer and to continue academic progress, while avoiding additional expense and health risks.

The University will work with students to address their specific needs in a manner that causes the least disruption possible to their plans for on-time graduation. Please contact your study abroad advisor, program manager or academic advisor with any questions.

I hope you will have another opportunity to participate in an international experience during your time at Carolina. UNC-Chapel Hill is ready to help you with future plans when University-sponsored global travel resumes. For now, I thank you for all you are doing to contain the spread of this virus.

Sincerely,

Barbara Stephenson

Vice Provost for Global Affairs and Chief Global Officer

U.S. Ambassador (retired)
