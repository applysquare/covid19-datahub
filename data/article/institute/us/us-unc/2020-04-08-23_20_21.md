Dear Carolina Community:

Since reducing our campus operations because of COVID-19, many of you have asked about refunds for campus housing and dining services. We understand the financial pressures that you and your families face, and we are pleased to share that the UNC System just confirmed today that we will be able to issue prorated refunds for these specific services.

This has been a very fluid process, and we are still working through the details of how these refunds will be calculated and when payments will be made to you. Refund amounts will vary from student to student depending on the cost of each person’s housing and meal plan.

We hope this update helps alleviate some of your concerns, and we will share more details as we have them. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate through these challenging times.

Sincerely,

Kevin M. Guskiewicz

Chancellor

Jonathan Pruitt

Vice Chancellor for Finance and Operations
