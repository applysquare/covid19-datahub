Dear Carolina community,

We are beginning our third week of remote classes, a way of learning and teaching that will continue through summer school. To address many questions and concerns, we’ve launched a COVID-19 Student Care Hub, a one-stop-shop for information that our students need.

Just last week, Microsoft Academic ranked us No. 1 in U.S. universities for our research to fight COVID-19 and the World Health Organization views us as a leader in finding a treatment.

In this week’s video message, join me in saying thank you to our researchers, to our health care professionals and to everyone for all you are doing every day to fight this virus. Stay safe! Go Heels!

Sincerely,

Kevin M. Guskiewicz

Chancellor
