Dear Members of the Rensselaer Community,

I write to share the disappointing news that Rensselaer is unable to conduct our traditional, in person Commencement exercises this spring. We plan to honor our graduates in the most special way possible under the current circumstances. On Saturday, May 23, 2020, in an online ceremony, we will officially award degrees to our graduates, and welcome them into our alumni and alumnae network.

When the public health situation allows us to do so, we will come together, in-person to celebrate our graduates, and to express our pride in their successes, and our gratitude for the sacrifices they have made for our collective well-being.

You will receive more details in the coming weeks. Please regularly visit the Commencement website and Commencement FAQs page for additional information.
