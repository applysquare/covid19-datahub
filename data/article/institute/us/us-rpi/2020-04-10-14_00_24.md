Even as we approach the final weeks of instruction for the spring semester, planning is in full swing for the summer semester. With an emphasis on protecting the health and safety of our community, and reducing the risk from COVID-19 disease, President Jackson announced that instruction for the summer semester, including Arch classes, will be delivered remotely.







To support students throughout the Arch summer semester, as well as any students taking online courses with us, Rensselaer student and academic services will be fully operational including the Advising and Learning Assistance Center (ALAC), Student Success, and Class Deans.







The Center for Career and Professional Development (CCPD) will continue to provide comprehensive and individualized services to assist all students with their searches for away semester opportunities, co-ops, internships, and full-time jobs. Students enrolled in the Arch Preparation Course should complete all assignments; the course outcomes are critical for success in securing semester away opportunities. To connect with the Career Counselor for a specific school, students may schedule an appointment on Joblink. Students may also utilize the “Chat with an Advisor” feature on the JobLink main page for on-demand assistance between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (EST), Monday through Friday, or email the CCPD.







In addition to information on the summer semester, we also want to provide additional information on a question that many of you have raised about adjustments to room and board charges for the spring 2020 semester. The Institute will be providing pro-rata room and board credits, net of Rensselaer financial aid. Credits will be posted in the coming weeks. Additional information on this topic will be available on the COVID-19 website.







We look forward to continuing to support you throughout the rest of the spring term and beyond. Please be well and continue to take the recommended steps to keep yourselves and our community safe and healthy.
