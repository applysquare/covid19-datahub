In light of the transition to remote instruction necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are implementing a temporary change to our academic and grading policies for the Spring 2020 semester. This decision has been taken after consultation with the academic leadership and subsequent review and recommendation for adoption by the Faculty Senate Curriculum Committee.

With this change, all students will have the option to convert a letter grade in any Spring 2020 course to a Pass/No Credit grade by May 15, 2020. Additionally, a grade of Pass in the Spring 2020 semester can be counted towards the graduation requirements for any program of study at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The selections for P/NC for this semester will not count against the P/NC limits stipulated in our academic catalog.

Please contact the Advising Hubs in your Schools should you have additional questions related to these changes.
