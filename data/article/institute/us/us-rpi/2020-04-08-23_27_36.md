We understand that over the course of the next several weeks, accepted students will be working together to make the best decision as to where they will continue their academic journey. We look forward to helping them make that very important decision.

I wanted to update you on the current status of our campus due to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In an effort to protect the health and safety of the campus community from the Coronavirus Disease, the Institute is suspending all in-person instruction (classes will be moving online) and all in-person visits to the campus for the remainder of the Spring academic term.

Our Accepted Student Celebration scheduled to take place on campus on April 4 will NOT BE HELD IN PERSON -it will be conducted as a VIRTUAL ACCEPTED STUDENT CELEBRATION on that day.

Accepted students may register for our Virtual Accepted Student Celebration at go.rpi.edu/ASC. Please note: students who have already signed up for the on-campus event will automatically have their registration transferred to the virtual event.

In addition, instead of on-campus daily information sessions and tours, we will be hosting a variety of webinars and virtual experiences including:



Information Sessions



Campus Tours



Student Panels



Webinars highlighting research, the Arch, and more!



Accepted students may view and sign up for these sessions at go.rpi.edu/virtual.

We also encourage you to join our social media platforms:

We appreciate your understanding that the health and safety of our community members is the top priority of Rensselaer. Please know that staff from both the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Office of Financial Aid are here to answer any questions you might have regarding the enrollment process at Rensselaer.
