The health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors are our top priorities. The ongoing, and accelerating, public health threat caused by COVID-19, combined with the guidance and restrictions from Governor Cuomo, have effectively placed Rensselaer into an expanded “Trigger 2” status, in accordance with our Pandemic Plan Protocols.

Until further notice, the physical campus will remain closed, except for critical operations, and all non-essential employees will continue to work remotely. Portfolio Business Continuity Plans continue to be in effect.

As previously communicated, we will maintain remote instruction through the end of the semester. We will proceed with the summer semester, whether through remote or campus-based instruction. Information related to summer semester on-campus residency will be forthcoming.

We must keep our community safe by listening to public health experts, resisting panic, and doing all we can to protect the most vulnerable in our midst. Using common sense, following the best hygiene practices, remaining calm, and adhering to our values are our best strategies for keeping everyone safe and healthy. Regular updates regarding both the coronavirus and Institute operations will be provided directly to the Rensselaer community electronically and posted to our COVID-19 website.

Thank you for the care that you have demonstrated toward each other as we work together to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our community. Our focus remains on keeping our community healthy, as we fulfill our important educational and research mission.
