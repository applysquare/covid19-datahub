The University of Wisconsin–Madison is expanding online offerings this summer to include more than 300 courses while in-person Summer Term courses are suspended due to the COVID-19 crisis.

“We know this is a challenging time for students, and we are here to help them continue their studies and advance toward graduation,” says Associate Dean for Summer Term Aphra Mednick. “The decision to suspend in-person instruction was made with the safety of our students in mind. We already had a robust online offering and in response, we are offering even more online courses than ever before so students can continue their academic progress.”

UW–Madison Summer Term is experienced in the online space, having offered online classes for over 10 years. With online Summer Term, students will be able to take in-demand courses, including general education requirements, interact with instructors and peers and find flexibility to fit in other summer obligations and plans.

The Summer Term scholarship application deadline is extended from April 1 to May 1. Students can apply for the Undergraduate Scholarship for Summer Study or the Summer Finish scholarship, for students who can finish their UW–Madison degree by enrolling in summer courses. Financial aid is always available for Summer Term.

And students can still take advantage of an online early start programs to earn college credit and build their Badger community. The Wisconsin Experience Summer Launch offers incoming first-year students the opportunity to take courses and engage with fellow students. CALS QuickStart allows incoming College of Agricultural & Life Sciences students to complete their first-year seminar. The Transfer Early Start Program helps transfer students make a smooth transition to UW–Madison before the fall semester.

“You can still be part of the UW–Madison experience this summer. In an uncertain time, one thing we can say for sure is that Summer Term is still happening,” Mednick says. “Whether you are hoping to focus on a difficult course, lighten your load for a future semester or stay on track for graduation, we’re committed to helping you find your path forward this summer.”
