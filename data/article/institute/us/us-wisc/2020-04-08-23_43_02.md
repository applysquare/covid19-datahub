In consideration of the health and safety of UW–Madison students, Guido Podestá, vice provost and dean of the International Division, has instructed that all IAP study abroad programs and IIP international internships planned for summer 2020 be cancelled. This includes programs offered in collaboration with CALS, WSB, and CoE, as well as Wisconsin in Washington.

This decision is being made now to give students ample time to arrange other programming that will allow them to meet their summer academic and professional goals.

The UW–Madison International Travel Policy and Guidelines restricts university sponsored travel to countries under a U.S. Department of State Advisory Level 3 or 4 or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Travel Warning Level 3. Currently, this condition has been met. While it is possible conditions around the world could change in the coming weeks, given the unique severity of the situation it is important to make this decision now to give as much notice as possible to students, faculty, staff, and university partners, so they can make alternative arrangements.

A decision regarding fall study abroad programming and international internships has not been made at this time. Conditions for fall semester international travel will be assessed in the coming months, in consideration of the safety of the UW–Madison community.

These are dynamic circumstances and IAP, IIP, and our partners will provide more information on programming options and answer student questions as the situation unfolds. Your cooperation and support are appreciated as we work to secure the safety of students and find solutions so that they can continue their academic activities with as little disruption as possible.
