Dear students, faculty and staff,

I’m following up on my message to you last week regarding the special grading option the university has developed for the spring semester. More details are now available on the Office of the Registrar website.

This option applies to undergraduate, graduate, capstone, and special students. Law, Medicine, PharmD and Vet Med students should consult forthcoming guidance provided by their Dean.

At the end of the Spring 2020 term, instructors will submit a standard grade to the Office of the Registrar. After the grade is received, students may choose to convert their letter grade in any course to one of two new grades: SD (Satisfactory-Disruption) and UD (Unsatisfactory-Disruption). The SD grade will count for all University General Education, degree/major, certificate, and PhD minor requirements and will satisfy future course prerequisites. The UD will not count for any credit. Neither of the new grades will be included in GPA calculations.

Please visit the website for more information, including an FAQ. More information will be added, so remember to refresh the page each time you visit for the most updated information.

Students, please talk to your advisor if you have questions about whether to use this option.

Instructors, if you have questions, please contact Instructional Continuity.

Thank you for your continued patience, flexibility and dedication to teaching and learning at this unprecedented time.

Karl Scholz

Provost

University of Wisconsin–Madison
