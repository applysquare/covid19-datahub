At the present time, campus events and meetings are canceled through May 15, 2020. However, given the predictions of the need for social distancing well after the peak of confirmed COVID-19 cases here in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, all face-to-face summer non-credit programs and activities are canceled, with the exception of a few that are authorized to run using distance learning technologies. This difficult decision follows UW–Madison’s announcement last week that all summer for-credit courses will move to online or alternative modes of instruction.

Program staff are asked to notify families and individual registrants of this campus decision to cancel face-to-face summer non-credit activities. Questions regarding specific program cancelations, including the possible rescheduling of events in the fall or next summer, should be directed to program coordinators. Refund requests should also be handled by program coordinators.

This guidance applies to most summer camps, tours, visits, field trips and activities, unless specific exceptions are sought and received. The policy includes, but is not limited to, activities sponsored by UW Athletics, RecWell and the Wisconsin Union. An additional update to the current cancellation of events and meetings beyond May 15 is being developed.

This policy does not preclude the possibility that special events and other limited activities may be permitted toward the end of the summer if the public health situation in Wisconsin improves dramatically in the coming weeks.

Broader questions regarding summer youth/pre-college programming may be directed to the Office of Youth Protection & Compliance (compliance@precollege.wisc.edu) or the Office of the Provost (provost@provost.wisc.edu).

Thank you for your understanding of this difficult decision.

Karl Scholz, Provost

University of Wisconsin–Madison
