Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

Clark University has no known cases of COVID-19, but we want to share the announcements below with you.

Before we do so, it is important to reiterate that based on all the information available to the University at this time, there remains a low risk of anyone contracting the virus while on campus. We are aware that these are anxious times and want to reassure you that we are monitoring developments continuously, that we will be direct and forthright in all of our communications, and that we have robust plans in place should additional actions be required. Further, we would like to express our appreciation to all members of the Clark community for your support for steps we are taking to address the COVID-19 challenge.

As you know, the situation affecting other places in the U.S. and beyond continues changing rapidly. In light of these developments and the imperative of protecting Clark’s students, faculty, and staff, our COVID-19 Response Team and senior cabinet have made the following decisions:

The University is canceling all admissions events involving large numbers of visitors from off-campus, including the open houses previously scheduled for April 4 and April 19. We are also suspending classroom visits and overnight stays by admissions guests. The Bassett Admissions Center remains open, and Admissions will continue to offer daily information sessions and tours.

The University is canceling all off-campus alumni events.

The University is canceling all events on campus that had been scheduled by outside groups of any size.

The University is canceling all international faculty/student programs this spring and summer, including, for example, the May Term in Luxembourg.

The University is informing individuals, offices, and organizations impacted by these decisions as rapidly as possible. These decisions will remain in effect until further notice.

Amid this fast-moving situation, the University is evaluating all dimensions of University operations on a constant basis, reviewing related decisions by other universities and colleges, and remaining fully abreast of the guidance that continues to emerge from local, state, and federal health officials. As we make any resulting decisions, we will inform you promptly through email updates. Please visit Clark’s dedicated website regularly for the latest information. We have expanded and reorganized the FAQs there for easier reference.

We urge you to take care of yourself and to continue being especially kind to one another during this stressful and complicated time.

Sincerely,

David P. Angel
