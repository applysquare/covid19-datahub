Dear Clark Students,

We hope you are a having a safe and enjoyable spring break.

The health and safety of all our Clark community are of paramount importance. As Clark prepares to resume classes on Monday, we want to provide you with the following updates regarding COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how they might affect you.

There are no reported cases of COVID-19 at Clark or in Worcester County.

For all returning students: In the interest of safeguarding your health, and that of others on campus, we urge you to follow the simple but effective illness-prevention measures outlined by the CDC.

In the interest of safeguarding your health, and that of others on campus, we urge you to follow the simple but effective illness-prevention measures outlined by the CDC. For students who have traveled to China, Iran, South Korea or Italy: If you have traveled to a country that has been assigned a Level 3 travel advisory by the U.S. State Department due to verified cases of COVID-19 — at this time, these countries are China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy — we have special instructions for you during this time: do not return to Clark or Clark housing, limit your interactions with others, and do not visit with other Clark students. This instruction is guided by related CDC recommendations for those returning from China, as you will see here. This instruction also means you should not come back to the Clark campus for 14 days after having returned from your trip to any of these countries. Instead of returning to campus, email the office of the Dean of the College, which will assist you in arranging accommodations with your instructors to continue your coursework during this time. The email address to use is dean@clarku.edu. Graduate students should contact grad_dean@clarku.edu. Meanwhile, carefully monitor your health for 14 days after returning to the United States. If you show any symptoms of illness, please follow the CDC’s guidance for such travelers specified here.

If you are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 (high fever, cough, shortness of breath) while at home, please immediately call (don’t visit) your health service provider. If you exhibit such symptoms after returning to campus, please immediately call (don’t visit) Clark Health Services at 508-793-7467. Please do not come to Health Services without first calling.

We will send further updates as information changes or the situation necessitates. New information and updates will be posted on the University’s dedicated COVID-19 website. In light of this rapidly changing situation, we encourage you to check that website frequently for the latest updates. If you have further questions or concerns, email them to covid-19-info@clarku.edu.

Thank you for your efforts to address these unexpected challenges and help keep yourself and others safe.

Sincerely,

David P. Angel

President

Paul Wykes

Chair, COVID-19 Response Team
