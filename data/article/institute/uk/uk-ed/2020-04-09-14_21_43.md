Boards of Examiners will give you a mark for your courses based on the in-course assessment (e.g. coursework assignments) you have completed by the end of the semester. In some cases, where the amount of available assessment does not allow the Board of Examiners to give students a secure mark for the course, they will record course outcomes as pass/fail only.

On a small number of courses, where there is no (or very little) in-course assessment, there may need to be some form of additional assessment to determine your course outcome. Your School will let you know if this applies to any of your courses.
