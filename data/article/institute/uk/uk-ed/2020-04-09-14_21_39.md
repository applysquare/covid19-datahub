  * Generally, yes. Teaching is carrying on (although remotely) so assessment of learning should carry on too. So you are still expected to submit any outstanding coursework assignments as normal, in order to ensure Boards of Examiners have as much information as possible to assess your performance. 
  * In some cases, you may have already demonstrated that you have achieved the learning outcomes for your course – for example, because you have already completed a major course work assignment, or have completed lots of coursework assignments for a particular course. In such cases, your School may decide there is no need for any further assignments for that course this semester. Your School will advise you if that is the case.
  * Schools will provide details regarding all outstanding assessments and any changes to deadlines. If you are in any doubt, (and on the principle of “better safe than sorry”) you are strongly advised to continue to work towards completing assessments as they become due.
