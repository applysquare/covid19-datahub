  * Pre-honours undergraduate students (SCQF levels 7 and 8): you will not have exams for pre-Honours (Years 1 and 2) courses. There will be a small number of exceptions to this, where a professional or statutory regulatory body (PSRB) requires students to complete further assessment, or where there has been no (or very little) in-course assessment for the course. You are already aware of particular requirements from your School – if you have any doubt you should contact your School for clarity.
  * Honours undergraduate and postgraduate (taught) students (SCQF levels 9, 10 and 11): you will take exams or other summative assessment such as additional coursework assessment or timed take-home (“open-book”) exams offered remotely.
  * If your School is setting an alternative form of assessment in lieu of exams, they will let you know the format, deadlines and timescales for this.
  * Your final exams this semester (or other forms of final, summative assessment) will not have a detrimental impact on your course marks. This means we will ensure your final academic year average is the same as, or higher than, the average you would have attained through assessment that has already been undertaken, or (as is the case with some continuous assessment) is currently in progress.
