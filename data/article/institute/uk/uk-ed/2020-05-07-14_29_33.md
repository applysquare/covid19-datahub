  * Examination Boards have a great deal of experience in taking account of a range of extenuating circumstances. They will be operating on a ‘help not hinder’ basis in determining course marks for Semester 2 and full-year courses. Information about how the special circumstances process will take account of Covid-19 is provided under “Learning Adjustments and Special Circumstances”.
  * In order to allow for extensions to assessment and the staggered submission deadlines and also in order to allow for staff sickness as a result of Covid-19, we may have to adjust the timelines for the release of results. We will confirm this as soon as possible.
