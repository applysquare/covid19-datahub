All teaching activity for taught undergraduate and postgraduate students will be delivered online from Monday 23 March or before where possible, for the remainder of the 2019/2020 academic year.

Given the decision to extend our policy on authorised absences, and challenges in delivering hybrid models of in-class and digital teaching, all teaching will be delivered online for taught students from 23 March, or before where possible. 

Academic faculty will decide how best to conduct teaching and learning activities, using a range of resources to best support students.
