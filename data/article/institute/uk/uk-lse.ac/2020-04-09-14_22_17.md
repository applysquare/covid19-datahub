All taught undergraduate and taught postgraduate exams and assessments scheduled for the Summer Term and the 2019/2020 In-year Resit and Deferral Period (IRDAP) will be delivered online or by other methods of alternate assessment.

Assessment type will be guided by academic discipline and faculty expertise. Students will be notified as early as possible about what online assessments mean in practice. Inclusion Plans will apply. 

If you have a disability or long term health condition and you do not have an Inclusion Plan in place, please see the [DWS Web pages](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/student-wellbeing/inclusion-plans). Please note that Individual Exam Adjustments are not the same as an Inclusion Plan, and IEAs cannot be applied to online assessments. 

Students also have the option to defer Summer Term assesments to the next appropriate assessment opportunity, if you feel this is more suitable for your personal circumstances.

We are investigating student visa implications as a result of this change and we will update you in due course.

If you have any questions about exam and assessment, you can contact the [Advice Team](https://lseportal.force.com/studentservices/s/enquiry-form).
