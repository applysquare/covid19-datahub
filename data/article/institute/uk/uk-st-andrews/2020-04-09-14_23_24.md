Yes. The University will deliver all of its teaching and assessment exclusively in online formats from the resumption of the semester after Spring Break (30 March 2020).

There will be no classes or face-to-face teaching in St Andrews for the rest of this semester. 

Remote learning means that you will have to be able to receive via the internet either a live-streamed version or a recorded version of your teaching in an environment where you can interact with staff and your classmates online. Alternatively (or additionally), you can watch and make notes on the recorded material later.

We expect that many of the methods of learning you normally employ will still stand you in good stead (though they may need to be adapted). Working remotely will nevertheless be a challenge for all of us and we need to make a concerted effort to adapt to these new conditions. Please make sure you give your tutors feedback and let them know how they can change their teaching so that it works better for you. We will all be learning together!
