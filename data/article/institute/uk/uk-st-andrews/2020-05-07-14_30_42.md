If you start out on a summer project but realise that you cannot finish it to your best ability, for instance because your living situation changes significantly over the summer or because you have to take on additional caring responsibilities, please notify your supervisor about this by 15 July 2020. We will be able to place you on a leave of absence from mid-May onwards and you can reengage to complete your final project at a later date.

If you would like to discuss a leave of absence, please get in touch with your programme convener or your School’s/Department’s Director of Postgraduate Taught Studies and the Registry Support Officer for PGT students ([reg-support@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:reg-support@st-andrews.ac.uk)). Please note that a leave of absence means that supervision will not occur during this time and could have consequences for your visa status and your funding, which will have to be carefully considered in advance.
