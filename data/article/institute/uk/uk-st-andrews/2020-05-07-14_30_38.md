Yes. Your School and your supervisor will have adapted your final module project so that you can complete it. This could involve working on existing data sets rather than collecting your own data. It could also mean that your final module assignment have been broken up into smaller parts of work. Importantly, whatever the initial plan for your final module, you will be given a chance to complete the module and your degree programme this summer.
