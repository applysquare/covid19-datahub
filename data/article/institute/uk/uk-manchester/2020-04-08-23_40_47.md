Well it’s been a strange couple of weeks for everyone to say the least. And who can believe it’s only been a week and a half studying or working from home?

We recognise that this is a difficult and challenging time for everyone; our students, staff and the University as a whole. With such a fast moving situation it can be difficult to make sure that everyone is receiving the most relevant communications at the right time. Please be reassured that we are doing all we can to make sure you are communicated with regularly, with the most up-to-date information.

As teaching and learning will continue online now and after Easter – it is important that you keep engaging with your course to complete your studies this year and to ensure that you are prepared for next year.

Over the past week we’ve been working at pulling together information, advice and guidance as well as a number of resources all into one place, to help you with the transition of working and studying from home.

Teaching and Learning Resources

These new webpages cover everything from guides on how to use various tools on Blackboard, Zoom for students, and a links to a number of resources to helping you learn from home.

With more and more people studying from home across the globe, LinkedIn Learning has made a number of their online resources available free of charge. We picked out a range of them that we think are relevant, such as tutorials on how to use all the different types of new software that we have been introduced to over the past week e.g. Zoom, Google Hangouts and Microsoft OneNote. As well as advice and tips on how to manage your time and staying productive at home.

LinkedIn resources

We’ll keep adding resources that we think might be useful as we go along.

Assessment and Exams

As previously communicated last week, in light of the coronavirus outbreak we are making changes to the way we organise our assessments and exams across the University. Read the full information here. All of our decisions are being made in your best interest to help you progress in your studies and earn a qualification which you can be proud of, and which will be valued by employers and accrediting bodies.

Your School will be in touch shortly with detailed arrangements for your particular programme of study.

We also encourage you to keep in contact with your Academic Advisor, and that they are still available to support you, albeit online. Remember that your academic advisor is there to support you with your:

academic progress

future plans

wellbeing and anything affecting your ability to study and reach your potential

Guidance on communicating with your academic advisor

Looking after your wellbeing

More than anything else your health and wellbeing is the most important thing during this time. If you find yourself struggling, the first point of call is our Student Support website which has online resources to help with issues around your wellbeing, as well as signposting you to other forms of help where needed.

Aside from your mental wellbeing, it’s also important to look after yourself by staying active, keeping busy and following a ‘normal’ routine as much as you can.
