Covid 19 update 7 April : New videos and new guidance for online exams

Dear students

As we approach the start of the summer term, I wanted to bring you up to date with the latest information and guidance we have published in the Covid-19 pages including important information about online exams.

New videos online

I have received quite a few comments and queries from students since my email last Friday announcing the introduction of a safety net score and further support for PGT dissertations, ISMs and projects. In response I have made the following videos which I hope will help answer your questions:

New guidance for online exams

Importantly for many students returning next week you will be undertaking online examinations for the first time. We have written and published guidance and advice to help you prepare for what to do and how these exams might look and feel. Even if your exams are not until later in the term, it is worth reading the guidance now, so you will know what to expect.

These are unsettling and difficult times for all of us and whilst we will not be able to welcome you back to campus in a physical sense, we are very much looking forward to engaging with you online at the start of the new term.

Kind regards

John Robinson

Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Teaching, Learning and Students
