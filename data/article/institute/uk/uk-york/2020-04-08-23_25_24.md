Covid-19 student email 27 March 2020

Dear student

We hope you are keeping safe and well. I am writing to you again today with updates from the University, and what this might mean for you. I also want to share our thinking about a progression and award “safety net” in advance of us providing fuller information next week.

Keeping yourself and those around you safe

Please continue to follow Government instructions to stay at home and only leave your flat for essential reasons such as to pick up food, medication, or for exercise once a day.

If you are living in student halls, or renting privately, we have received updated Government advice that students remaining in their accommodation should now stay where they are and not attempt to travel.

Rest assured we are here to support you and we will continue to maintain essential campus facilities and services.

Assessment and progression

With the decision to move our teaching and assessment online (except for undergraduate first year assessments, which have been cancelled), our first priority was to set up an assessment framework across the University that is suitable for the difficult circumstances we are all in. John Robinson's message yesterday explained how we are doing this.

Our second priority is to adapt our criteria for progression from year to year and for calculation of degree classes. We have carefully reviewed what is happening at other universities. Many of you have commented to me on the Exeter approach, for example. This and other examples are helping us to shape the best solution for York. We will be in touch next week to let you know how our own “safety net” will work.

Supporting your wellbeing

There is so much happening at the moment to help our staff and students to keep in touch, share ideas and stories and generally start to rebuild our close community in an online world.

To help you through these challenging times, your student unions, support staff and other support groups are developing new health and wellbeing provision, which we will be sharing with you in the coming days.

In the meantime, please remember we are here to offer you support. You can access the Student Hub, Open Door, and your College teams online. The maths and writing skills centres are also there to support you with your academic needs. Your department and your tutors are working hard to set you up with online learning and assessments arrangements for the start of next term. We will be able to update with more details nearer the time.

Keep talking to each other and we will continue to work hard to give you clarity in these times of uncertainty.

Remember to keep checking your emails and the Covid-19 pages for updates.

Please take care, keep safe and we will be back in touch next week.





Kind regards

Charlie

Vice-Chancellor
