Supporting your wellbeing

Dear student

I hope you are keeping safe and well as best you can. As you will know, the government has now advised against any unnecessary travel, so wherever you are (in on-campus accommodation, private accommodation in York, or back at your family home) you are advised to stay there.

We are committed to supporting your health and wellbeing during this difficult time, so we’d like to tell you about some new services we are launching to help you.

Firstly, University of York students now have access to the Big White Wall. This is a 24/7 online peer and professional support service with trained counsellors. Big White Wall provides a safe space to share your thoughts and feelings. While on the site, you are totally anonymous to other members in the community.

Secondly, we have created a new web page all about looking after your wellbeing during the pandemic. It brings together and outlines the support available from the University, the Students’ Unions and has links to useful external advice.

These two new services complement existing University services, such as:

the Student Hub and Colleges who are happy to arrange telephone or email appointments to discuss anything that is worrying you - from advice on your private rental contract, to problems with your flatmate or reporting self-isolation.

the Open Door team continues to offer appointments. If you are new to Open Door, simply complete the online referral form and they will get in touch with you via email or telephone.

the Writing and Language Skills Centre, and the Math Skills Centre continue to support you improving your academic and language skills

The Students’ Unions are also working hard to help students during this time. YUSU and GSA have launched a range of online wellbeing initiatives. 'Keep Home and Carry On' from the GSA includes a calendar of online activities such as: fitness schedules, music playlists, family activities, online coffee meet-ups, book recommendations and even online karaoke. And, there is a YUSU Covid 19 Community Facebook page, for students to link up and swap tips, events, activities and ideas for dealing with the challenges we are all facing. In addition, the YUSU Advice & Support Centre (ASC) and the GSA Advice Service are available via email.

As we move to more online working it is important to remember that we are a global community of equality, inclusion and respect. If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour we encourage you to report it to the University.

Finally, I want to reassure you that we are listening to your feedback and working to improve our support and online services. The pandemic is making life difficult for all, so please stay safe and well. By working together, and showing respect and understanding, we can all help one another.
