As part of our priority to safeguard health during the global coronavirus outbreak, the University has decided to postpone the July 2020 Degree Ceremonies.

Students whose degree ceremonies are affected have received an email from Stuart Croft, Vice-Chancellor, on 2 April, letting them know.

Students will still graduate

All those students meeting the requirements of their award will still graduate in July 2020 as usual, but this will be in absentia (in their absence) rather than at an event.

At the same time, we will post out degree certificates and, for undergraduates, update Higher Education Achievement Reports. The actual date of graduation will be determined by the approval of the Pass Lists by Senate, expected to be in mid-July.

Ceremonies are being rescheduled

Degree ceremonies are the highlight of each academic year, and a very special occasion for the University, as well as for graduating students and their families and friends. The July ceremonies will therefore be rescheduled on alternative dates in the 2020/21 academic year. This will be a great occasion to celebrate studentsâ€™ achievements with family and friends and for the University and departments to provide them with a well-earned congratulatory farewell.
