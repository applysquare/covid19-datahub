Dear colleagues,

As the health and wellbeing of our students and colleagues remains our top priority, we continue to review all of our work at Warwick in relation to Covid 19. As of today – Monday 16 March 2020, we wish to make staff aware of the following key advice and decisions we have made in addition to Public Health England (PHE) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice as we ready ourselves for more significant impact.

The Prime Minister has this afternoon asked everyone, where possible and practical, to work from home. Heads of Department will now work with colleagues to implement the Prime Minister’s request with immediate effect. We had, of course, already started work to support staff to prepare for working from home. All buildings will be open as normal from tomorrow and you should discuss planned working arrangements with your line manager. There will be no overseas travel on University business. The University will remain open, but there will be no face to face teaching or assessments. Academic departments will be in touch with students via local routes to advise on changes and we are providing extensive support for academic departments to be able to move swiftly to online teaching and assessment. We are providing wellbeing support and advice via the Employee Assistance Programme.

In addition to the above points, students have also been advised:

Students who cannot go home will be able to use campus accommodation if required. The Library and study spaces remain open for the time being. We are providing student support and advice to students via Wellbeing Support Services.

I know that many of you have been running at pace to help support our students and wider community in response to Covid-19. These are unprecedented times and I’m grateful to everyone for your commitment and calm.

I want to thank everyone who is pulling together to make this work at incredibly short notice, and I wish to particularly thank those staff colleagues who will need to be on campus to keep some services operating. This is particularly important as a number of our students will still be living on campus and we will need to support them and provide essential services. I know that HoDs in such areas will be talking to colleagues to see how best we can sustain these services while meeting the Prime Minister’s request.

Obviously there are more details yet to be worked out (and we will provide these to you as soon as we can) and we are having to send this update outside normal office hours when many may not see it quickly, but I wanted you have our response to the Prime Minister’s request as soon as possible. In this period, please do take care of yourselves, your families and our community. Please continue to wash your hands thoroughly and regularly. Practice social distancing. If in doubt, self-isolate. And please continue to pay close attention to further updates that we will send to you by email, supported by regularly updated FAQs online.

Best wishes,

Stuart

Professor Stuart Croft, Vice-Chancellor.
