Not necessarily. Although Boards of Examiners will assign module marks where possible, there may be instances in which there is insufficient data available to assign a mark with confidence. This might include, for example:

  * Instances where the assessment in question examines programme learning outcomes which have not been, and will not be, assessed elsewhere in the programme.
  * Instances where external professional bodies have imposed restrictions on assigning marks.
  * Other instances, not outlined here, where these is insufficient data available to assign a mark with confidence.



However, please that be assured that if the Board of Examiners is unable to assign a module mark, you will be given the opportunity to complete the assessment under normal conditions, at the next available opportunity, for full marks and without any financial implications.
