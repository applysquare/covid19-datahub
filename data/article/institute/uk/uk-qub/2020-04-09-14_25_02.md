Our advice to avoid travel outside Northern Ireland remains. However, if any students not normally resident in Northern Ireland wish to return home as a result of the pandemic, the University will ensure that they suffer no academic disadvantage. However, they must consider the requirements of their visa, if applicable. If you are an international student from outside the EU and intend to return home early or need additional advice, please contact International Student Support via [**immigration@qub.ac.uk**](mailto:immigration@qub.ac.uk).

Discuss your situation as it relates to your research with your supervisor. If you can undertake your research from another location, and maintain monthly digital meetings with your supervisor.
