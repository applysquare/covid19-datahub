If you have achieved or been assigned marks for all of your modules, you will be awarded your degree, subject to having met all relevant academic and professional requirements. If you then retake an assessment after this point which results in an improved module mark, we will issue you with an amended transcript.

If you defer or are unable to take an assessment and the Board is unable to assign you a module mark, we will not be able to award your degree until after you have completed your assessments.
