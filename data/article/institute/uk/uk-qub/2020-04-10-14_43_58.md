There are two options open to you, each of which is designed to support your progression with no detriment to your academic achievement. You can either:

**(1) Submit all assessments due in the current period.**

  * Your assessments will be marked. If you are unsatisfied with your performance in any assessments with a submission date on or after 16 March 2020, you will be able to retake the assessments under normal conditions, at the next available opportunity, for full marks and with no financial implications. The highest mark will be retained.



**(2) Defer some or all assessments with a submission date on or after 16 March 2020.**

  * Where it is possible to do so without compromising academic standards, you will be assigned module marks based on your academic performance up to 16 March 2020. If it is not possible to assign a module mark, or if you wish to take the deferred assessments despite having received an assigned module mark, you will be able to take the assessments under normal conditions, at the next available opportunity, for full marks and with no financial implications. The highest mark will be retained.



The diagram below outlines these options:

Your health and wellbeing, and that of your friends and family, should be your primary consideration at this moment. While we encourage you to complete all assessments if you can, we understand that this may not be possible.

Please read the FAQs below to ensure that you understand the full implications of your decision.
