We understand that there may be circumstances which prevent you from taking an alternative assessment. If you are unable or do not wish to undertake the alternative assessment, you can complete the [COVID19 Assessment Student Deferral Form](https://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/AcademicStudentAffairs/AcademicAffairs/GeneralRegulations/SecureFilestore/Filetoupload,956888,en.doc) in advance of the assessment. Your academic progression will then be considered under the Supplementary Regulations in the first instance.
