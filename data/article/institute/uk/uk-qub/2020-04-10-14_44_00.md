We accept that all students are currently working in the most exceptional of circumstances, and that daily lives have been significantly disrupted. You therefore do not need to submit an application for exceptional circumstances. Boards of Examiners will take the current emergency situation into consideration when determining final marks, whilst maintaining academic standards.
