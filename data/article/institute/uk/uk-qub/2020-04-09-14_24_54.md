Your alternative assessment(s) will be scheduled within the normal examination period from 27 April until 30 May 2020. If you are taking the assessment outside of the UK and Ireland, please note that assessment release and submission times will be communicated in British Summer Time (GMT + 1). Please note that this applies to programmes which use the standard teaching and assessment dates. Some programmes use different academic calendars and may therefore have assessments scheduled outside this period.
