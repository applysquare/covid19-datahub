In some subjects, particularly those with professional recognition, it may not be possible to apply the ‘safety net’ approach. If this applies to you then your School will contact you to explain what approach they will be taking, whilst doing everything within their power to make sure you are not disadvantaged. We are working closely with Professional Bodies to adapt their requirements to the present situation and, if this applies to you, you will receive further information when this process is complete.
