The safety net approach applies to all undergraduate and postgraduate taught students in all years of study (including those who were on a Study Abroad placement) with the exception of those students on certain programmes which are subject to professional regulation/accreditation (see list [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/campaignpagebanners/Final,Safety,Net,FAQs.pdf)), students on pre-sessional English programmes and those studying with Liverpool Online (where alternative arrangements are in place).

Part time students who have completed modules in 2019/20 will have the safety net applied when they have completed the full assessment for their year (level) of study.
