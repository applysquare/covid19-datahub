We are aware that English Language testing has been postponed in several countries for a number of weeks now, which will create delays in students being able to take a test once test centres are reopened. Queen Mary offers alternative provisions to be able to meet our English language requirements:

  * We accept a range of different qualifications, details of which can be found on our [Alternative English Language Qualification webpage](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/international-students/englishlanguagerequirements/alternative-qualifications/).
  * We will be accepting the new TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition. This is a test being offered temporarily with the same format and scoring as the TOEFL test. Further information can be found on the [ETS website](https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/).
  * Due to the current restrictions, we have also introduced additional Pre-Sessional English programmes. We now offer Pre-Sessional English that is taught entirely online and Pre-Sessional blended learning programmes which will allow you to study online and on campus. Please visit our [dedicated webpages for further information](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/language-centre/pre-sessional/pse-summer-dates/). If you have any questions about our Pre-Sessional programmes then please [contact the Global Engagement office.](mailto:globalengagement@qmul.ac.uk.?subject=Pre-sessional%20English%20question%20)



We will consider Duolingo English Test results for entry onto our distance learning programmes.
