Update from government

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab led the government’s Covid update today. He reiterated that there is evidence the peak of the epidemic is passing due to the measures working, but warned that the UK is still at a "delicate and dangerous moment".

The lockdown will not be eased unless government is confident a second peak can be avoided, which is considered a real risk. Government is working on plans for a "second phase" but this will be not be finalised until scientific advisers report on the latest evidence in early May.

The government today also pledged more than £1.5bn over the next five years as part of international efforts to find a Covid-19 vaccine and announced visa extensions for frontline health and care workers. Midwives, radiographers, social workers, pharmacists and their families with visas due to expire before 1 October 2020 will receive an automatic one-year extension.

Yesterday, the government announced that all staff and residents of UK care homes will be tested for the virus whether or not they have symptoms.
