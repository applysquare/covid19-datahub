As a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, we are having to make changes to summer assessments.

We know what a difficult time this is for you, and so the new arrangements are designed to minimise anxiety for students. We are also making sure we protect the quality of your degrees, and that we give you the best opportunity to complete your studies within the normal time-frame.

With those aims in mind, our approach is that as many students as possible will graduate or progress to the next year without undertaking examinations originally scheduled for April-June 2020.
