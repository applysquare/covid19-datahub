As the situation is evolving we are monitoring our attendance at international recruitment events. Some events are being cancelled by the organisers. If you are registered to attend an overseas event please check with the event organiser.

**UK recruitment events**   

Regretfully, Lancaster University will not be attending the UCAS HE Fairs in the UK due to the suspension of UCAS Fairs in March. We are monitoring the situation and will update this page with alternative opportunities to discuss study options shortly. You can also visit the UCAS website for further updates.

**Connect with us online**

to help you find out about Lancaster and ask us questions, we have added a series of [webinars](/study/connect/events/) and plan further online events.
