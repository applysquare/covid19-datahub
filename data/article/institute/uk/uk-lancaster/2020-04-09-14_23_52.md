Following the UK governmentâ€™s announcement, we are awaiting further clarification about what the cancellation of exams scheduled to take place in May and June will mean for applicants.  We understand that the government will work to ensure that students will get the qualifications that they need, but the details about how and when are yet to be announced.

Further details about the UCAS process and updates on the planned changes will be published on the [UCAS website](https://www.ucas.com/coronavirus) as soon as details are available.
