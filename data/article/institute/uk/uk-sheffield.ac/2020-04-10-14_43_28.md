  * We have a [new research website](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/research/coronavirus) for all the amazing research our colleagues are doing to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on society, with a rapid response through research, collaboration and volunteering.
  * **Thursday 9 April and Tuesday 14 April 2020** have been designated closure days for staff - see [advice for staff](/coronavirus/faqs/staff) and [advice for students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students) for more information.
  * We have introduced a safety net policy for all exams and assessments due to take place. This will recognise the value of marks students have already achieved up to **March 2020** for assessed work. This means that no student who passes the year will receive an average mark or overall degree class lower than their current overall mark or degree class.  
  * Government advice states that people **must stay at home** and should only leave for one of four reasons: shopping for basic necessities, including food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible; one form of exercise a day - alone or with members of your household; any medical need or to provide care for a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from essential work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home. **It is absolutely imperative that staff and students adhere to this.**
  * **Student travel home within the UK is no longer classed as essential**. Students should remain where they are currently living and follow social distancing rules - see [advice for current students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students) for more information.
  * Staff carrying out **business critical work** that requires them to be on campus - where there is a significant consequence to health, safety and welfare if the work cannot continue - should have been notified and must carry a valid photo ID/UCard with them at all times.
  * Stay at home for seven days if you have a high temperature and/or a new continuous cough. Anyone sharing your household will need to also stay at home for 14 days from when you first developed symptoms.
  * The best defence to prevent the spread of coronavirus continues to be **good hand hygiene practices** and **social distancing**.
