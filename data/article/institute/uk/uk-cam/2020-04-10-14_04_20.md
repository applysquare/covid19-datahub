Dear all,

I am pleased to note that, even in the current circumstances, the University’s central bodies continue to operate – albeit online. The University Council, our main policy-making body, met yesterday for the first time since the University had to interrupt its normal operations. As would be expected, its discussion focused on measures to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus crisis on the University.

Staff – Contract Extension

We have said before that all staff would continue to be paid throughout the emergency. Particular and understandable concern has been expressed by employees and workers whose contracts are coming to an end within the next few months, and who are therefore faced with uncertainty or financial hardship.

The University Council yesterday approved a scheme to support individuals whose employment contracts and assignments ended, or are due to end, between 16 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. The Contracts Extension Scheme will support individuals who can continue their existing work by extending their contracts or assignments, on the same terms, until 31 July 2020. For individuals who cannot continue with their existing work, the University will try to find alternative work, on the same terms as their existing arrangements, until 31 July 2020. Where neither is possible, individuals will be offered a payment, which for most people will be equivalent to their usual monthly salary, until the end of July.

The scheme will be reviewed before the end of June to assess how it is working, and whether it should be extended or altered. Any changes will be put to the Council for approval. Our Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Institutional and International Relations, Professor Eilís Ferran, will be writing to all Heads of Institution later today to provide further detailed guidance on the scheme.

It is important to note that the Contracts Extension Scheme is separate from the Government Furlough Scheme, designed to support employers who cannot maintain their current workforce because their operations have been severely affected by Coronavirus. Under both schemes the University will need to consider whether staff can be redeployed into alternative roles. Later this week, Professor Ferran will be asking for Institutions’ help in identifying staff who might be eligible for the Furlough Scheme.

Staff – Guides to Working from Home

As we all continue to adapt to the new realities (and challenges) of remote working, the University’s HR Division and the ourcambridge team have published two practical and thoroughly useful guides to working from home – one for managers, and one for individuals. Their focus is on building relationships and fostering wellbeing. They aim to share best practice and advice to help make people feel connected and well-supported in these times.

Counselling

University and College staff and students resident in Cambridge are eligible to join Qwell – a new online counselling and wellbeing platform launched this month by MIND (Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and South Lincolnshire). Qwell provides confidential chat-based counselling from qualified counsellors, free of charge. Full details are available on the HR Coronavirus website. While this government-funded online service is not intended to be a replacement for face to face counselling, it does provide an alternative for those unable to access face to face counselling services.

Students – Assessment

The guidance on methods of assessment has been updated, and students can expect to get further details later today from Professor Graham Virgo, Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education.

I explained last week that the University’s goal in setting out its principles and policies for modified assessment was to ensure fairness and academic rigour while taking account of students’ particular needs and circumstances. Having considered the many responses to last week’s announcement – in particular from students who believed they would be disadvantaged by the modified assessment policies – we have worked with student representatives, and with colleagues from Schools, Faculties and Departments, to ensure a fair approach.

I acknowledge, once again, that not all arrangements will be to all students’ complete satisfaction. I emphasise, once again, the unprecedented context in which these hugely complex arrangements have been made to minimise the disruption to our students’ education.

Tackling COVID-19 – Testing (1)

Last week I shared news of the launch of a new rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19, developed by a University of Cambridge spinout company, and now being used at point-of-care in order to rapidly diagnose patients. Timely and accurate diagnostic testing is key not only to helping us combat the current pandemic, but to enable us to move into the recovery phase in the months ahead.

Many colleagues have expressed an interest in responding to the call for volunteers to support the Government COVID-19 Testing programme in Milton Keynes. While fully supportive of staff wishing to contribute to these national efforts, and while recognising the need to respond as quickly as possible, we have had to balance this against the duty to ensure that any volunteering arrangements are sound, safe and sustainable.

One of our duties as an employer is to make sure that the scheme does not adversely affect employees wishing to become involved. The University’s preferred approach will be a secondment arrangement, allowing employees to be released from their normal duties to undertake this important work, while being paid by the University and retaining their usual pay and benefits.

Guidance for institutions, including a template for the secondment agreement will be circulated soon by our HR Division.

Tackling COVID-19 – Testing (2)

I am proud to announce that the University of Cambridge is collaborating with AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline to support the national effort to boost the country’s COVID-19 testing capacity.

As part of the UK government’s plans to enhance diagnostic capacity, we are working with these two industrial partners to set up a new testing laboratory at the University’s Anne McLaren laboratory, on our biomedical campus. This facility will enable quicker, larger-scale testing for COVID-19. Crucially, it will also contribute to the development of alternative chemical reagents for test kits to help overcome current supply shortages.

Alongside this new testing facility, AstraZeneca and GSK are working together to help optimise processes at the other national testing centres in Milton Keynes, Alderley Park and Glasgow, providing expertise in automation and robotics to increase diagnostic capacity over the coming weeks.

Tackling COVID-19 – Transport

Even as we contribute to enhancing national testing capacity, the battle against COVID-19 rages on in our hospital wards. To ensure that key workers are able to get to our biomedical campus, NHS workers and University of Cambridge cardholders with an essential worker letter can now travel for free on the Universal bus service. NHS workers will be expected to show a valid NHS ID card. University staff will need to provide a University ID card and their essential worker letter. Details on travel in and around Cambridge, including measures taken by bus companies to ensure the safety of their staff and their passengers, are available on the University’s Travel and Transport page.

More UL Resources, and Collecting COVID-19

Our University Library continues to increase the resources it is making available for students, staff and visitors during the COVID-19 outbreak. The UL has now published a catalogue for its growing database of academic resources. The list of available publications is truly astonishing – ranging from historical press archives to scholarly magazines on pop culture, from Early Modern printed books to specialist medical journals – and I would encourage you all to explore it if you have the time.

As the repository of the University’s memory, the UL is also inviting all of us to reflect on – and help preserve the memory of – these extraordinary days. The “Collecting COVID-19” project aims to capture the experience of the Collegiate University and the city of Cambridge during the pandemic. Members of the collegiate University and the wider community are being invited to submit digital and physical records of our times – including (but not limited to) videos, photographs, posters, leaflets, audio recordings, creative projects, journals and diaries.

As news reaches us of the effect of the virus at the highest levels of the British government, our thoughts and very best wishes are with everyone afflicted – or affected – by the disease.
