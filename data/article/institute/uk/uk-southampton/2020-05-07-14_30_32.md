Spring term ended on 13 March as the University brought forward the end of the academic term.

Our Halls of Residence remain open for students that either want to stay, or need time to plan arrangements to go home and therefore you are welcome to stay should you wish.

International students, please ensure that you are remaining compliant with the conditions of your visa, see our [specific Visa webpage](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/studentservices/visa-and-immigration/covid-19-information-for-current-visa-students.page).

The University plans to commence teaching online for all undergraduate students at the start or the summer term, with all assessment conducted remotely. This means that you may continue your studies from home during this period.
