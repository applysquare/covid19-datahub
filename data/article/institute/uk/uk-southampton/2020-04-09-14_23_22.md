The Assessment Period will run from 1 â€“ 19 June; term will officially end on Friday 19 June.

All programmes being offered during this current academic year will have forms of assessment that can be undertaken off-campus and indeed outside the UK.  There will be no assessment tasks for the remainder of this academic year that will require you to be on campus.
