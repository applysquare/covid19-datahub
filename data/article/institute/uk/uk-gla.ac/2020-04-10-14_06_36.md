3 April 2020: Message from the Principal

To recognise the extraordinary contribution that so many colleagues across all parts of the University have made during the Covid-19 crisis two additional days of leave are being given to all members of staff.

As the Principal announced in a video message, Thursday 9 and Tuesday 14 April are to be given as extra holidays to extend the Easter weekend in recognition of the dedication and hard work the University of Glasgow community has demonstrated through this difficult period.

Principal's update - 3 April 2020

It is recognised that those members of staff who continue to support University buildings that remain open, and who are regarded as ‘essential workers’ during this period will be expected to perform their duties in accordance with the rota arrangements in place. Essential support staff who are required to work on these days will be awarded an additional two days of leave to be taken at another time, and they will also receive the same level of enhanced pay as they would for working on the Public Holidays of Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.

As the current lock down arrangements continue, it is important for all of us to apply a degree of flexibility in our ways of working and to put in place some boundaries that we can adopt with regards to our working day, particularly as many of us are working remotely. We should all take regular rest breaks away from work. This is vital to supporting and maintaining our ongoing good health and wellbeing.

The University understands that many of us may have had personal travel/holiday plans in place and others may have future plans that are likely to be affected by the ongoing situation. Given the current circumstances under which we are working and which are likely to continue for some time, we would strongly encourage colleagues to utilise your annual leave entitlement, alongside other elements of our University policy provisions as appropriate, to have a break away from work and spend time relaxing and with other members of your household.

We would encourage you to liaise with your immediate line managers to discuss and agree annual leave plans as normal. There is a broad expectation that we should have taken somewhere in the region of 60-70% of our annual leave entitlement by 30 September 2020. It is really important to our health and wellbeing and to that of our families that we schedule, and look forward to time away from work.

For some this will not be practicable, particularly for those colleagues who are engaged in the delivery of essential services. In cases such as this we will try and be flexible in giving consideration to appropriate carry-forward arrangements.

There is a detailed suite of University leave policy provisions, all of which can be found on our web pages, including Support for Staff with Caring Responsibilities Policy, and Emergency Time Off to Care for Dependents in addition to our Flexible, Home-working & Lone Working Policies.

All Coronavirus related guidance and FAQs can be found on the Coronavirus: Information for Students and Staff webpages, and the full A-Z of all HR policies can be accessed on the HR webpages.

College and University Services HR Teams remain fully operational and ready to support all line managers and staff; their contact details can be found here.
