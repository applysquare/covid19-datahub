31 March 2020: Further information about exams

Message for students in Junior and Senior Honours, students in 3rd, 4th and 5th year of an Integrated Masters Programme, students intending to graduate with a general/designated degree in 2020 and students on a Postgraduate Taught (PGT) programme.

We will be providing you with the assessment timetable and details on how the approach to assessment outlined below will operate later this week, but we wanted to give you a brief update about the forthcoming exam diet. We can confirm that the University will be taking a ‘no detriment’ approach with these assessments.

We very much appreciate that many of you are very concerned about arrangements for the forthcoming assessments, particularly in relation to how they may impact on your degree outcomes. We want to reassure you that we are taking careful steps to ensure that, given these extraordinary circumstances, we act in your best interests. We have also been working closely with the SRC in developing these proposals. We shall be proceeding with a ‘no detriment’ approach. What this means is that, while we strongly believe it is in your best interests to take your scheduled assessments unless you are unable to do so, your results from the forthcoming assessment diet can only improve your final outcomes and not disadvantage you.

There are, however, a number of important factors to take into account which affect some student groups more than others, for example some students have completed insufficient assessment so far for us to make a judgement; some degree programmes are more heavily dependent on final examinations than others; and specific arrangements will need to be made for students on professional degree programmes such as Medicine and Dentistry. We are therefore working as quickly as possible to develop more detail on these arrangements as well as other possible options for students who are, for whatever reason, unable to complete their assessments at this time. Please do not contact staff for further information at the moment, we will issue these details to you as soon as we can. In the meantime, we would again encourage you to continue with preparation for the assessment diet as best you can.

We hope that in providing this message we can reassure you that, while we are strongly encouraging you to complete all your assessments, we fully accept that everyone will be affected by the current pandemic one way or another, and in some cases very significantly, but this will be taken into account when the assessment results and final degree outcomes are confirmed.
