2 April 2020: Publication of exam timetable

On Tuesday, we described our broad approach to the forthcoming exam diet. Today, we are writing to inform you that the timetable has been published and can be found here: https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/registry/exams/timetables/#april/mayexaminationtimetable





There are four types of assessment described within the diet:

The majority take the form of 24-hour open online exams/assessments ; in this case, you may complete the exam at any time during the scheduled 24 hour period, although we would not expect you to spend more time in total on the exam than is indicated in the guidance that will accompany your exam information.

; in this case, you may complete the exam at any time during the scheduled 24 hour period, although we would not expect you to spend more time in total on the exam than is indicated in the guidance that will accompany your exam information. Some of you will be taking timed online exams/assessments , in which case your school will supply more information. If you are taking such an exam, the time available will include time for downloading the questions and uploading your answers. (The total time available will be double the time you should take to complete the exam itself.)

, in which case your school will supply more information. If you are taking such an exam, the time available will include time for downloading the questions and uploading your answers. (The total time available will be double the time you should take to complete the exam itself.) In a small number of cases, your school may set an alternative assessment , and

, and In a small number of cases, we have decided to postpone an exam or assessment altogether.

Your school will provide you with more details about any timed exams, alternative and postponed assessments, as soon as possible.

Our aim is to ensure that all exams and assessments are compliant with our Accessible and Inclusive Learning Policy, and therefore accommodate the needs of all students including those who would ordinarily require additional adjustments through the Disability Service. As a result, we anticipate that further adjustments will only be necessary in a very small number of cases.

For those of you who are less familiar with the use of Moodle for assessment, there will be an opportunity to practise in advance. We will enrol you in a University Moodle site next week where you can familiarise yourself with paper formats and the means of uploading your completed exams and assessments. More details of this will follow, together with information from your school, which may be operating its own site to familiarise you with the specifics of its assessments.

To reiterate the message we issued on Tuesday, we would like to reassure you that the University will be taking a ‘no detriment’ approach. More information about this approach will be provided as soon as possible. These are extremely difficult times for all of us and we know that the changes we have made to your exams and assessments will be challenging for you. We are taking every care we can to help you to complete the exams successfully. And finally, I wish you well in your preparations, appreciating that you are doing so in extraordinary circumstances.
