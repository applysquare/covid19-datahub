We will not be holding face-to-face examinations in physical locations at the University. The examination timetable **will not** be published as expected on 27 March 2020.

It is possible that some examinations will be changed to a remote examination with the questions released electronically at a specified time, and the answers to be submitted by a later specified time. A schedule for remote examinations will be published by 24 April 2020.
