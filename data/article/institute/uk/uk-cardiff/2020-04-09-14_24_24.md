It is with deep regret that we have decided to postpone the summer 2020 graduation ceremonies. We appreciate this news will be disappointing, but we can assure you that this decision has not been taken lightly. Our primary concern is the health and wellbeing of our students, their guests and our staff – especially in such difficult and challenging times.

Unfortunately, we are not in a position to say when the postponed ceremonies will run. As soon as we do, we will update [the graduation website](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/graduation) and contact all students who were eligible to attend July’s ceremonies with the new arrangements. All students will have the opportunity to celebrate with us on a future occasion.

It is important to stress that our decision does not impact on us awarding you your degree. Provided you meet the requirements of your course, we will confer your degree. We will make sure we get your award documents (degree certificate and final transcript) to you in the normal way, as soon as possible after you receive your results.
