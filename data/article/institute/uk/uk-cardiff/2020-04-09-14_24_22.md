#### Accessing emergency or hardship money

If you are experiencing financial difficulty we have a Hardship Fund called the Financial Assistance Programme. [Details of this and how to apply are on the student intranet](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students/money/emergency-money).

There are no emergency loans available, as these need to take place face to face. You will need to [apply to the Financial Assistance Programme,](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students/money/emergency-money) and we will make an assessment as soon as possible based on current need.

#### Financial issues related to returning from placements abroad

Please see our section on [study, work or volunteer placements abroad](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/coronavirus/current-students#placements) if you are not able to travel from your placement abroad due to financial reasons.

#### Refunds for tuition fees

During these unprecedented times, the Universityâ€™s priority and commitment is to ensure that you are provided with appropriate learning opportunities and to ensure that you have been supported to achieve the relevant learning outcomes of your programme. We are working hard to maintaining teaching, learning and service provision remotely in what is an exceptional and rapidly changing situation.

We do not yet know what the full impact of Coronavirus will be or the timescale for the current lockdown. The University is working extremely hard to address the wide range of issues that are facing our students, staff and local community and we need time to put in place the full range of measures and actions necessary to ensure you are able to continue and progress in your learning.

The time to submit a complaint if you are dissatisfied with the actions taken by the University is at the end of the academic year, and through the [University complaints procedure](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/public-information/students-applicants/complaints). This provides for a range of remedies, including financial.

#### Student Funding and Advice service

The building and offices are closed, but advice is available by email, phone and Skype appointments. Priority is being given to estranged students, care leavers, care carers, asylum seekers and students whose funding issue is impacting on their current year of study.

To contact the service, telephone +44 (0) 2922 518 888 or email [adviceandmoney@cardiff.ac.uk.](mailto:adviceandmoney@cardiff.ac.uk)
