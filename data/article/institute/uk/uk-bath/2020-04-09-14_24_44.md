If you have any concerns regarding your immigration status please [email the Student Immigration Service](mailto:studentimmigrationservice@bath.ac.uk).

The Home Office has now released updated immigration guidance for visa holders offering extensions until 31 May 2020 for visas that expire between 24 January 2020 and 31 May 2020. The extension is not automatic: you will need to [contact the Coronavirus Immigration Team](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents) to update your immigration record if this applies to you. Please consult [our web pages](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/coronavirus-information-for-tier-4-visa-holders/) for more information.
