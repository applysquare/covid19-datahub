For undergraduates and those taking taught graduate courses, we will deliver all teaching online for the remainder of Semester 2, which ends on Friday 29 May 2020. 

For those of you completing projects, your departments will let you know the arrangements they are making. We will provide more information on assessment arrangements when we have it and if in doubt you should speak to your Personal Tutor or Director of Studies. 

The Skills Centre is offering [online skills support for your studies](/announcements/online-skills-support-for-your-studies/).

If you have a question about placements, please discuss this with your placements team.
