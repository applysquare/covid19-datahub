We know that those of you in University-owned student accommodation have wanted clarity on payment going forwards and we wanted to update you on this as soon as we were able. 

Following approval from the Universityâ€™s governing body (on 25 March 2020), we can now confirm that we will only charge for accommodation that is being occupied after the timetabled Easter vacation. Further details on this will be provided by ahs (Accommodation and Hospitality Services).
