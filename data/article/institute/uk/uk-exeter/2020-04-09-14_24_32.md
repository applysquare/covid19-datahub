Please see ‘ _How will summer examinations and assessments operate?_ ’ for the three categories into which examinations and assessments will fall. These include  
• Papers that must be completed in a specified 24 hour period in your own time. There will be no fixed duration but the expectation is that the paper will take approximately the same length of time as the original planned examination (including adjustment for Individual Learning Plans).  
• Papers that must be completed in a specified 24 hour period in your own time but with a fixed duration. The duration will be adjusted with respect to relevant Individual Learning Plans, and will begin from the point at which a student begins their examination.
