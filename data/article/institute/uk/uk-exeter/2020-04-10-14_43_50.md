For online/remote sessions taking place from 23 March 2020, there is no requirement for you to complete an absence request within the LISA attendance system, if you are unable to attend online sessions.

Please check the module [ELE page](https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/) to catch-up on any missed teaching and contact your module lead if you need additional information or support.
