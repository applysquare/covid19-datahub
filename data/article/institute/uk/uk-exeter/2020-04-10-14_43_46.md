Following advice from Public Health England and the Department for Education, we advise that anyone in student accommodation (for example University residences) does not undertake further travel, we also advise you only leave your accommodation for the following reasons:

  * Shopping for basic necessities
  * One form of exercise a day
  * Medical needs
  * To provide essential care or help to a vulnerable person, or to travel to or from work where this cannot be done from home
