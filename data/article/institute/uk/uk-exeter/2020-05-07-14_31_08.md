At the end of the summer examination and assessment period, all results will be scrutinised at the level of each module and of each individual student at the Universityâ€™s Assessment Progression and Awarding Committees (APACs). Throughout this process, our aim is to ensure the fairness and integrity of the Exeter award, as well as to support our students through this difficult situation in a way that allows them to progress or be awarded. Under the current circumstances, we will be moving back the dates of these APACs sufficiently to allow colleagues to undertake marking, and enable us to make considered recommendations in all cases. APACs will take place from 22nd June to 1st July. This means you will receive your grades and outcomes from summer assessments slightly later than originally planned on 8th July.
