Posted on March 11, 2020 Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn

McMaster continues to monitor developments around COVID-19. The University’s preparations and response is coordinated by its Crisis Management Team which began meeting on the coronavirus in January.

The University looks to Global Affairs Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada along with public health agencies in Ontario to guide its decisions in working to maintain the health and safety of campus.

The risk of contracting COVID-19 in Canada is still considered to be low.

McMaster classes and activities continue to run as normal.

The physician is currently in self-isolation at home but had seen patients and interacted with colleagues and staff on the afternoon of March 9th.

All those individuals who were in the hospital clinic are being contacted and Public Health, in collaboration with the hospital, is in touch with all those who were in direct contact with the physician and who need to go into self-isolation at home.

New information for McMaster students about international travel

The evolving global situation surrounding COVID-19 has raised many questions from students with travel plans for a variety of countries. With government travel warnings changing frequently, McMaster has decided to end all undergraduate and graduate student international travel for McMaster-related activities. This decision takes effect immediately.

Graduate students with specific circumstances can request a waiver. Such waivers need the written approval of either the provost or the vice-provost, International.

Students who are already on exchange or doing fieldwork or have a placement in another country should be in touch with their university supervisor to discuss any concerns they may have including whether they wish to return earlier than planned.

Students choosing to return to campus should follow all of the travel warnings and guidance provided through Global Affairs Canada. Students travelling for university-related activities also have access to International SOS which provides assistance and information to travellers on university business.

International Travel

Global Affairs Canada is the best source for the latest travel information and advice. McMaster faculty and staff are reminded to monitor Global Affairs for any travel restrictions as well as any conditions being imposed on Canadians entering other countries or transiting through countries to their destination. Please continue to monitor the site if you are away as conditions may change. Faculty and staff should carefully consider any international travel and the potential for any restrictions that might occur while they are in another country.
