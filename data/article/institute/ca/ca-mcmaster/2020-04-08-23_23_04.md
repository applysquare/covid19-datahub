COVID-19 Update: Academic considerations and new travel information

Posted on March 5, 2020 Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn

McMaster continues to monitor developments around COVID-19. The University’s preparations and response is coordinated by its Crisis Management Team which began meeting on the coronavirus in January.

The University looks to Global Affairs Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada along with public health agencies in Ontario to guide its decisions in working to maintain the health and safety of campus.

The risk of contracting COVID-19 in Canada is still considered to be low.

McMaster classes and activities continue to run as normal.

Academic Contingency Planning

Classes and academic programs are continuing as usual at McMaster. As the university continues to monitor the developing COVID-19 outbreak, it is important that faculty members and instructors consider their options to expand the ways they provide course programs to students.

The university provides faculty, staff, and students with many options for incorporating online methods of teaching that facilitate access off campus, complement in-class teaching, and enhance the learning experience.

The MacPherson Institute, UTS, and Campus Classroom Technologies are here to support those wishing to explore these alternative methods of delivery. We want to provide supports that will allow you to be flexible in the face of unexpected events.

This type of preparation is part of the Business Continuity Planning the university recommends every unit undertakes to be better prepared for any events that may impact the day-to-day functioning of the university. A business continuity guide and workbook is available here.
