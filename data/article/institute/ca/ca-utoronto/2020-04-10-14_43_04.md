To our students, and to all members of our U of T community:

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a shift in all our lives but your ability to adapt to and evolve with these unexpected challenges has brought to light your strength, ingenuity and resilience.

In response to the advice of public health officials and government travel advisories, we want to update you on steps the University is taking to support students, faculty, librarians and staff as we plan for the summer.

**Support for Students:**

**Summer Courses**

To limit the spread of COVID-19, courses that start in May (F and Y summer courses) will be delivered remotely. A final determination of the delivery mode for summer courses that start in July will be made by June 13. This change will allow you to continue your studies while keeping our communities healthy by continuing to practice social distancing.

To make it easier for you to plan, we have [created a central directory](/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus/information-by-faculty) where you can find information on the summer session classes from all Faculties and divisions. 

**Programming and Support**

Our staff members continue to work to respond to your needs and are dedicated to delivering services and supporting your continued success at U of T.

Many co-curricular programs and events at [all three campuses](https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/covid-19/) are continuing and are being delivered in an online format. Appointments with Accessibility Services and Academic Success are being offered over the phone and through video conferencing and [U of T MySSP](https://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/hwc/myssp) continues to be available to all students online or by phone at 1-844-451-9700 or 001-416-380-6578 (outside of North America).

**Online Self-Declaration of Illness**

The University is temporarily suspending the need for a doctor’s note or medical certificate for any absence from academic participation in the University.

Please use the Absence Declaration tool on [ACORN](https://acorn.utoronto.ca/sws/#/) found in the Profile and Settings menu to formally declare an absence from academic participation. Record each day of your absence as soon as it begins, up until the day before you return to classes or other academic activities. The University will use this information for academic considerations and to monitor the overall health of our community.

In addition to this declaration, you are responsible for contacting your instructors to request any academic consideration.

**Support for Faculty, Librarians & Staff:**

We want to acknowledge and recognize the outstanding work and dedication of our faculty, librarians, and staff in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and in supporting our students.

Things have been changing quickly, often daily, but you can read about our plans for the month at [the HR and Equity website](http://www.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/). There you will find information about [continuing University supports for employees](http://www.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/news/covid-19-continuing-university-supports-for-employees/).

As always, for the most up-to-date information, please visit [U of T’s COVID-19 update page](/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus) and the [COVID-19 FAQ for students](https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/covid-19/) and take time to review the [frequently asked questions](/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus#faq). If you have questions that are not addressed, use the Contact Us button at the top of the FAQ section to submit your question.

Thank you for working with us as we navigate this situation together. U of T students, faculty, librarians and staff have a reputation for brilliance, innovation and resilience, and every day you are proving that to be true.
