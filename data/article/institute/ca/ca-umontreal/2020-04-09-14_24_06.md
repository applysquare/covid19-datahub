Dear Member of the Université de Montréal Community, 

The University is suspending all teaching activities until further notice, in accordance with the government decision announced earlier today. The suspension includes both in‑person and online classes. For student placements, instructions will be sent tonight to department heads, who will contact the students. 

We want to reassure our students about the remainder of the semester. The University is currently assessing all options so that teaching can resume, either remotely or by another method that meets both the demands of this exceptional moment and academic requirements. 

## Notice to staff about Monday 

We are informing all staff that the weekend is being extended up to the morning of Tuesday, March 17. There will be no work on Monday and employees will be paid for the day. 

Only essential services will be provided during this period, including basic animal care, IT, security and similar services. The administration will contact the employees whose services will be required on our campuses. 

The University will contact staff again on Monday with instructions about work up to the end of the suspension ordered by the government. Employees are asked to check their e‑mail or the University's website late Monday for information about returning to work. 

## Open or closed?

The University remains open. However, many services will be closed. 

The clinics on campus that host student placements will be closed, with the exception of the veterinary hospital, which will continue to operate in emergency mode. The Centre de santé et de consultation psychologique remains open. 

Starting Saturday, March 14, the CEPSUM will be closed for an indefinite period. The libraries will remain open. 

We will provide a detailed list of which services are open and closed on Monday. 

In this fast‑changing situation, I want you to know that we are doing our utmost to make the best possible decisions in the interest of everyone's health and safety, without losing sight of our core mission: to educate our students, support them until they graduate, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. 

The University administration continues to monitor the situation closely. We will keep you informed of any decisions and actions. 

We encourage you to consult the [Urgence UdeM](https://urgence.umontreal.ca/) site. You can also write to us at [urgence@umontreal.ca](mailto:urgence@umontreal.ca) if you have any questions or concerns. As well, the government has set up a COVID‑19 general information line: dial 1‑877‑644‑4545

Rector
