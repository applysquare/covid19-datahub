Effective Monday, March 16, to protect the health and safety of our community, the front door to the financial aid wellness center in Thackeray Hall will not be open for face-to-face visits. However, the office is fully functioning remotely. We look forward to continuing to serve students and their families through every other means possible, including phone and email. The office will be answering phones as usual Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. ET +1-412-624-7488 (Choose option 2.). Due to the anticipated high volume of calls, your quickest response to a question is through email: [finaid@pitt.edu](mailto:finaid@pitt.edu).
