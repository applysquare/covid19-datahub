[As announced by Chancellor Gallagher](https://www.chancellor.pitt.edu/spotlight/covid-19-pandemic-pitts-actions-0), the University has shifted exclusively to remote learning approaches, effective March 23, 2020.

The [University Center for Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.pitt.edu/) has been working with faculty to prepare for this possibility and developed tools to support online and remote instruction. We are evaluating classroom experiences such as laboratory and performance classes. Individual schools, departments and instructors will be providing additional information on specific classes and programs. All students will receive communication from their instructors about next steps for their courses. Students should be monitoring their pitt.edu email accounts.

Pitt IT has resources available to help students who are experiencing connectivity issues or who may not have access to reliable technology or Wi-Fi at home. Contact the 24/7 IT Help Desk by calling 412-624-HELP(4357) to learn more.

The University will deliver summer courses remotely, with the possibility of a few exceptions for clinical or field experiences that may become possible later in the summer. More details about summer sessions will be forthcoming.
