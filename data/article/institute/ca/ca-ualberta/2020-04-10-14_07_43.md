As the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to persist for a significant period, the University of Alberta has made the decision to offer Spring and Summer 2020 courses through remote delivery. This decision ensures you have certainty about how courses will be delivered and that the term(s) can be offered as outlined, it also allows you to make informed choices when registering for classes. The move to remote delivery for the Spring and Summer 2020 terms balances the health and safety of students; instructors and staff with academic success.

We anticipate that additional courses will be made available in the coming weeks, creating further opportunity for you to progress academically. All course offerings will be finalized for April 18 for the Spring 2020 term and by June 19 for the Summer 2020 term. Please check back in Bear Tracks to see if there are new offerings that interest you.
