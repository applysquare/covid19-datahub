As was shared in Fridayâ€™s update, this morning the university implemented more stringent access control to our physical spaces. With a few exceptions, this has involved closing our buildings to the public. Entry to each building is limited to those individuals with pre-existing card and/or key access. Given that many of you are already working and studying from home, the impact on you should be minimal, but we want you to know that taking this important next step will help us as we follow the advice of health officials to assist with physical distancing. Also, effective this morning, all food outlets on campus, with some exceptions in SUB and HUB Mall, are also closed.

Even in these unique times, a number of vital university functions must continue and some of these will require staff to be present on campus. Examples include the University Health Centre, our district energy system; and many functions addressing health, life, and safety on campuses. Each faculty and unit is in the process of determining which vital services still require on-campus delivery - and will be working with their employees and graduate students to determine what that will look like from an in-person staffing perspective.

As these determinations are made, managers and supervisors will work with their employees to transition as much work to at-home delivery models as possible while also ensuring a safe work environment for those who are required to be on our campuses.

Anyone who requires support services - be they academic, wellness, IT, etc. - should check online to find out the best way to access the specific service they need.

Again, please continue to check this site for the latest updates and information.

Thank you for your ongoing compassion, patience, and willingness to adapt.
