Dear U of A Students,

We know how hard our students and faculty work each semester and recognize the tremendous amount of stress you must be under as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on your studies. All post-secondary institutions across the world are addressing these issues. We’re focused on the best interests of the University of Alberta community.

We are working to define and share additional details and implications of the credit (CR) or no credit (NC) grades adopted for Winter 2020. We received many questions and concerns over the weekend. To provide more detail and clarity, we’ve added further information to our website:

The Credit (CR)/No Credit (NC) System (including honours program grading)

GPA/Student Letter

Academic Standing

Final Exam Exceptions

Later this week, we will be sharing information and answering questions though a new audio or video platform as we adapt to our changing environment.

Steven Dew, PhD, PEng.

Provost and Vice-President (Academic)
