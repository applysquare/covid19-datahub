Update from the Public Health Response Team regarding cases of COVID-19 in our community

Many of us are now working and studying remotely, greatly decreasing our risk of coming into contact with COVID-19 on our campuses. The Public Health Response Team remains in close contact with Alberta Health Services, and they are continuing to advise us about preventative steps to keep us safe.

It is expected that more Albertans will contract COVID-19 in the coming days and weeks—and some of them will no doubt be members of our community. AHS will continue to be in direct contact with any individuals who may be impacted. Out of respect for affected individuals, as well as adhering to privacy laws, we will not widely report every case that involves a member of our university community. Following the lead of AHS, we will provide support and guidance to the relevant individuals as and when these increasing events occur.

Partnership with AHS and Butterdome as Assessment Centre

Added: March 27, 6:00 p.m.

On March 24, Alberta Health Services temporarily took over the care and management of the Universiade Pavillion (Butterdome) to create a secondary assessment and treatment centre facility. The University of Alberta is proud to be able to contribute to our province’s growing response to fight the spread of COVID-19. AHS safety protocols are in place to ensure the health and welfare of the U of A community. Medical assessment and treatment at this facility will be available only by appointment as referred by Health Link and booked by Public Health. Drop-in visits will not be permitted.
