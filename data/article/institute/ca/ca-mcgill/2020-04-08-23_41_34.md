By now, all students should have received information from their Professors about modifications to their courses for the remainder of the term. If you have not yet heard anything, please contact your Instructor right away to ask for this information. Students can review the “Academic Measures” website for their options if they are concerned about their ability to finish a course this term. Students can also check with their Academic Advisor, Program Director, or Supervisor to discuss further, and to seek additional clarity.
