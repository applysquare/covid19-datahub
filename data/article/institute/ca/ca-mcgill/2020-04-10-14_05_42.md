The Library has automatically renewed all checked-out items that were originally due between March 1, 2020 and June 14, 2020. The new due date for these materials will be June 15.

The Libraryâ€™s physical branches are closed in conformance with government and campus directives through May 1. No fines will be accrued during this time. There are still a full suite of online library services available, including electronic resources through the catalogue or Databases A- Z list, the Ask Us! service, and teaching services. Visit the Library's website for questions about online services and account information.

Items can be placed in the returns bin on the street level at the McLennan Library Building. Items can also be sent by mail to the McLennan-Redpath Library Complex (3459 McTavish Street Montreal, Quebec H3A 0C9).
