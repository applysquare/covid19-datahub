Following the Quebec government’s extension, until May 1, of the suspension period for academic activities in higher education institutions, the University will remain operational. Only necessary functions and activities will continue to be provided on campus, while academic activities are migrating over to remote delivery starting next week.

All McGill academic and administrative staff—including contract employees whose contracts are valid during the extended suspension period lasting until May 1—will be paid. Casual and work study employees who were scheduled to work during the suspension period will also be paid.
