Dear members of the McGill community,

Although we are still dealing with much change, it cheers me to see how nimbly our community continues to adapt to the current situation. “Normal life” may still be a way off, but your resilience and positivity are an ongoing source of inspiration to me.

Here are today’s updates relating to COVID-19:

Compensation

Following the Quebec government’s extension, until May 1, of the suspension period for academic activities in higher education institutions, theUniversity will remain operational. Only necessary functions and activities will continue to be provided on campus, while academic activities are migrating over to remote delivery starting next week.

As per clarifications from the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the University confirms that all McGill academic and administrative staff—including contract employees whose contracts are valid during the extended suspension period lasting until May 1—will be paid. Casual and work study employees who were scheduled to work during the suspension period will also be paid.

I would like to remind our casual and work-study employees to consult the timesheet instructions on the McGill coronavirus FAQs.

Course activity

By now, all students should have received information from their Professors about modifications to their courses for the remainder of the term. If you have not yet heard anything, please contact your Instructor right away to ask for this information. I also want to remind students to review the“Academic Measures” website for their options if they are concerned about their ability to finish a course this term. Students can also check with their Academic Advisor, Program Director, or Supervisor to discuss further, and to seek additional clarity.

Student health resources

The Student Wellness Hub has mobilized as many of its resources as possible to continue offering support to our students. However, due to theunfolding public health emergency, the Wellness Hub’s GPs are being pulled into the public healthcare system. The Hub can no longer maintain its capacity to offer physical health appointments, even remotely, but is committed to offering as much virtual support as possible.

However, many of the Hub’s counsellors are now able to offer follow-up appointments virtually, and nurses can offer support by telephone. You can access a wide range of support at a distance, from emotional support groups and COVID-19 information sessions to the McGill Art Hive and workshops for managing stress and anxiety; a listing of online support programming is available on their website.

There are also off-campus services available to students. Maple is one way of accessing an appointment with a GP, at a distance. The University has worked with Blue Cross and Maple to eliminate up-front charges for international students covered by Blue Cross. This service is available to Canadian students, but it may not be covered by all provincial insurance plans or supplemental insurance. While many healthcare services off campus will be reimbursed by your insurance plan, most will require payment up front. Canadian students covered by StudentCare insurance can get reduced rates by visiting providers that are part of the StudentCare network.

Students also have access to free, remote mental health and well-being support via your keep.meSAFE Student Support Program, with real-time chat and telephonic consult available 24/7 via the My SSP app. Video and tele-counselling options are also available by appointment, call 1.844.451.9700 (or 001.416.380.6578 if outside Canada or the USA- call charges apply). Please note that given this time of heightened concern, call and chat volume may be high and wait times may be longer than usual. After downloading the free My SSP app from your device’s App store, ensure your profile is up to date and that you have allowed push notifications as a way of staying in touch with relevant support.

We are continuing to update the McGill coronavirus page with new information and FAQs. If you have a question that isn’t answered on the FAQ, please write to COVID-19.info [at] mcgill.ca.

Thank you, as always, for your patience and dedication. I hope you are keeping healthy and in good spirits.

Sincerely,

Fabrice Labeau

Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) on behalf of the University Emergency Operations Center
