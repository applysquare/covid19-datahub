If you are a manager of staff whose work is not computer-based, please print this email and display it in a common work area for them to review.

I promised to communicate on a regular basis regarding UBC’s response to COVID-19.

In my latest update, I discuss the extension of the on-campus research curtailment and Remote Work Arrangements, supports for both domestic and international students, and the important work that UBC researchers are doing with regard to COVID-19. There’s also a musical treat at the end of the video.

You will find my update, in both video and text format, at https://president.ubc.ca/letter-to-the-community/2020/04/03/covid-update-april-3/.

For the latest updates regarding COVID-19 and UBC’s response, I encourage you to visit https://covid19.ubc.ca/.

Thank you for your patience, your understanding and your empathy as we navigate this challenging time. Together, we will get through this.

Stay safe.

Santa J. Ono

President and Vice-Chancellor
