This message was originally sent to undergraduate students by the Office of the Registrar.

To help stop the spread of COVID-19, we made the important decision to proceed with Spring Term 2020 with no in-person course activity. This means that we will hold all classes and exams online (with the exception of CLIN and PRA courses).

We want you to have a quality learning experience at Waterloo during these times of unprecedented change. We also want to make sure that you can continue to make progress towards earning your degree.

Tuition fees

In these challenging circumstances, we remain committed to bringing you the quality learning experience you expect from Waterloo. In order to support this commitment, tuition fees will not change.

As some of our student services have been modified or will not be accessible to those located at a distance from our campuses, we are currently reviewing all incidental fees. You should expect to hear about any changes in these fees by Friday, April 3.

Please visit the Student Awards and Financial Aid (SAFA) website for information about available financial aid, processes, and deadlines.

Changes to OSAP

To ease the financial burden on students during the COVID‚Äê19 outbreak, the provincial and federal governments will temporarily defer loan payments and interest accrual for six months for students borrowing through the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP).

These changes will come into effect March 30 and last until Sept. 30.

A few things to note about the Schedule of Classes:

It will be updated by April 1; this includes the cancellation of some classes and that all dates/times and locations will be removed.

If a class has been cancelled, it will not appear in your schedule.

In an online-only academic term, no class "conflicts" will occur.

Course programming

With no in-person course activity this term (with the exception of CLIN and PRA courses), all classes and exams will be online. This may mean that some courses and/or labs will not be available. In light of this, departments and faculties are working on contingency plans to allow students to complete their programs as efficiently as possible.

You are encouraged to contact your academic advisor if you require guidance.
