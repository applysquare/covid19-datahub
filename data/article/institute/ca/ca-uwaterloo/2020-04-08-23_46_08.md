This message was originally sent to employees by Catherine Newell-Kelly, registrar.

To help stop the spread of COVID-19, we made the important decision to proceed with Spring Term 2020 with no in-person course activity. This means that we will hold all classes and exams online.

To prepare for the alternative delivery of courses, we have revised some important dates to the Spring Term.

Revised important class schedule dates to note:

April 1: the class schedule will be updated; this includes the cancellation of some classes and that all dates/times and locations will be removed.

Course programming

With no in-person course activity this term (with the exception of CLIN and PRA courses), all classes and exams will be online. This may mean that we will not be offering students some courses and/or labs.

Faculties and departments are working on contingency plans to allow students to complete their programs as efficiently as possible. I am grateful to instructors and staff for their extraordinary efforts to provide students with a quality learning experience during the Spring Term.

If students have questions about the Spring 2020 course schedule, please let them know that they can contact The Centre on askthecentre@uwaterloo.ca.
