With hundreds of remote courses expected to be run in the Spring term, we are encouraging instructors to use these systems to help us respond to your requests in a timely manner and manage staff workloads.

We have also launched a LEARN Community Group called Remote Teaching to give instructors a place to share resources and help one another. You can self-register in this group from the top of your LEARN page.

We thank you for relying on us to help you in your transition to remote teaching. We – and your students – are inspired by your ongoing commitment to effective teaching and meaningful learning.
