This message was originally sent to spring graduands and their families by Feridun Hamdullahpur, president and vice-chancellor.

With deep regret, we will not be able to conduct in-person convocation ceremonies in June; they will be delivered in a different manner to celebrate our new alumni.

It’s important to update your address in QUEST as you will likely receive your diploma by mail.

You will have a chance to attend a ceremony at a later date.

As the University of Waterloo responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, the well-being of our students, their families, and our campus community is our top priority.

After serious reflection and consideration, it is with great disappointment that we inform you that all in-person convocation ceremonies will not take place at Waterloo in June.

The extraordinary circumstances where we find ourselves, however, have forced us to do what is best for our community. Having the chance to meet and celebrate with Waterloo’s newest alumni and their loved ones is something I personally hold close in my heart. I will greatly miss being able to share in your celebrations and honour your accomplishments.

You will receive your diploma

Your convocation is the culmination of years of hard work, passion, and commitment. You have had the unwavering support of your friends, family, and community – including everyone here at the University. We want you to know we will confer degrees in June so you can start on the next steps of your career journey.

We will make sure that you get your diploma most likely in the mail. Please also watch your email inbox in June for your “virtual” convocation.

We will send these documents to the home address that we have available for you in Quest. Please ensure that we have the correct address for you in Quest by June 1, 2020.

We are working to give you the best experience possible as you graduate from Waterloo this spring.

You can choose to attend a ceremony in person at another time

We know that your family and friends who have supported you may wish to celebrate this milestone with you. We will give you and your classmates the opportunity to attend an in-person convocation ceremony at another time. While we know that this may not be an option for some students, we want to make sure that you have this choice to come back to campus and celebrate your accomplishments.

Although we hope to be able to welcome you to Waterloo in the fall, we do not know exactly when this will be during this period of great uncertainty. We will share more information with you by July 1, 2020. Please know that we look forward to you joining us to celebrate your graduation and that we will do all that we can to provide you with more information as soon as it is available.

The past two weeks have shown how resilient and understanding our community is in the face of unprecedented times that are impacting each of us. Thank you for making the University of Waterloo a stronger, more vibrant university with you as a student and soon to be alumnus. Please know that I am incredibly proud of you.
