# Flight schedule Canada ## March 22 - May 4, 2020 While we're reducing our domestic service by about 50 per cent, we are committed to keeping critical economic lifelines open for the 38 communities we serve across Canada. The situation with coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, but as of March 23, we will continue to offer flights to all of the cities we currently serve in Canada with decreased frequency. The following schedule represents March 22 through May 4, 2020 and includes all current frequency adjustments. **These adjustments are temporary and could change as more information becomes known.**
