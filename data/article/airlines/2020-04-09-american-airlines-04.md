Due to the reduction in demand, American Airlines has extended the suspension of flying to Hong Kong from our Los Angeles hub through March 27. Flights to Hong Kong from Dallas/Fort Worth are scheduled to resume Feb. 21. We will continue to review our flight schedule to ensure we can accommodate the needs of our customers and will make additional refinements as needed. ### Frequently asked questions: **When will American run a schedule change and inform customers who were booked on these flights?** On Feb. 9, American will run a formal schedule change, and customers who are booked on impacted Hong Kong flights will see their reservation updated on [aa.com](https://www.aa.com). Our teams will contact affected customers directly to accommodate their needs. Customers who booked through a travel agent will be contacted by their agency directly beginning Feb. 9, or customers can reach out to their travel agency. **My flight was canceled and I don’t want to rebook. Can I get a refund?** Yes. If a flight is canceled and a customer chooses to not be rebooked, they may request a full refund by visiting [aa.com/refunds](https://www.aa.com/refunds). **About American Airlines Group** American Airlines offers customers 6,800 daily flights to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries from its hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C.
