Delta will suspend operations in 11 U.S. markets beginning July 8, 2020 while customer volume is significantly reduced to help lower costs as we mitigate the crisis due to COVID-19. As permitted by the U.S. Department of Transportation, which has instituted a process for airlines to adjust service where it is ‘reasonable and practicable,’ Delta will suspend operations to the below 11 airports, which make up approximately 5 percent of the domestic airports Delta serves. All of these airports will continue to receive service from at least one other carrier after Delta suspends its operations. Here are the 11 affected stations: * Aspen, CO (ASE) * Bangor, ME (BGR) * Erie, PA (ERI) * Flint, MI (FNT) * Fort Smith, AR (FSM) * Lincoln, NE (LNK) * New Bern/Morehead/Beaufort, NC (EWN) * Peoria, IL (PIA) * Santa Barbara, CA (SBA) * Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA (AVP) * Williston, ND (XWA) “As the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta continues to face an unprecedented impact to our business, and suspending operations at these airports will reduce costs where customer demand is low,” said Sandy Gordon, Senior Vice President – Domestic Airport Operations. “We will move quickly to work with affected customers, whose patience we sincerely appreciate as we navigate this unprecedented time together.” Delta will re-accommodate customers whose travel is impacted as a result of service suspensions in these stations. Affected Delta employees will be provided pay protection options through Sept. 30, 2020. Additionally, Delta is indefinitely suspending service to Ottawa International Airport, effective June 21. Delta has announced an 85 percent reduction in our second quarter schedule, which include reductions of 80 percent in U.S. domestic capacity and 90 percent internationally. **Changing Travel Plans** Customers with impacted travel plans have added flexibility to change their flight. Delta has extended [waived change fees](https://news.delta.com/flexibility-times-change-delta-extends-ability-rebook-coronavirus-impacted-travel-2-years) and the flexibility to travel through Sept. 30, 2022, to customers with canceled travel through September 2020. Eligible customers include those who have: * Upcoming travel already booked between now and Sept. 30 as of April 17, 2020 * Canceled travel from flights between March 2020 and September 2020 Customers can easily cancel and change their bookings on [Delta.com](http://www.delta.com/).
