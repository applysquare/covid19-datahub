_**Editor's Note June 16: This schedule has been updated since publication. Details listed below.**_ Delta's summer schedule continues to be shaped by customer demand, CDC guidelines and government travel regulations. While the June schedule is significantly reduced in comparison to last year, customers will see the return of several major routes, both U.S. domestic and international, which were previously suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers traveling with Delta can feel confident in a safe flying experience. In addition to requiring customers and employees to wear [face coverings](https://news.delta.com/facecoverings) throughout the travel journey, Delta has implemented policies like capping seating between 50 and 60 percent to ensure [customer spacing](https://news.delta.com/delta-expands-onboard-customer-spacing-blocked-seats-all-aircraft) on all aircraft, elevated its cleaning measures to deliver [a new standard of clean](https://news.delta.com/delta-clean-delivers-new-standard-airline-cleanliness-now-and-always), and [streamlined its in-flight services](https://news.delta.com/delta-responds-customer-and-crew-feedback-adjusts-food-and-beverage-service-board-and-clubs) to decrease touch points on board. Customers also have [added flexibility](https://news.delta.com/delta-extends-change-fee-waivers-onboard-social-distancing-free-travel-medical-volunteers) if they need to change their plans. Here's a snapshot of where Delta is planning to fly in June. This schedule, including routes and frequency, remains subject to change due to the evolving nature of COVID-19. Specific restart dates will vary for previously suspended routes due to the lifting of travel restrictions and other operational requirements.
