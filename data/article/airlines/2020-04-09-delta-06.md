Delta has previously announced service suspensions and postponements to Italy, which can be found [here](https://news.delta.com/delta-suspends-atlanta-rome-service-march-11-through-april-30). The airline will not operate flights to Italy during the government-mandated emergency measures and travel restrictions period. On Tuesday, Delta announced a planned 15 percent systemwide capacity reduction to align with expected air travel demand. Details of these expanded schedule changes will be shared later this week.
