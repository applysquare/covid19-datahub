## Customer Demand Leads to More Domestic Flying in July

In response to improving demand for air travel, American is planning to fly 55% of its domestic schedule and nearly 20% of its international schedule in July 2020 compared to the same period last year. The airline’s July systemwide capacity amounts to approximately 40% of July 2019 flying.

American saw an increase in demand in May. By the last week of May, the airline carried a daily average of about 110,000 customers per day — an increase over the approximately 32,000 average daily customers the airline served in April.
