(NASDAQ: AAL) is getting ready for summer travel by restoring more flights, offering double AAdvantage® miles for flights booked in June, re-opening key Admirals Club lounges, expanding flexible policies and continuing its robust health, well-being and cleaning procedures. ## Customer Demand Leads to More Domestic Flying in July In response to improving demand for air travel, American is planning to fly 55% of its domestic schedule and nearly 20% of its international schedule in July 2020 compared to the same period last year. The airline’s July systemwide capacity amounts to approximately 40% of July 2019 flying. American saw an increase in demand in May. By the last week of May, the airline carried a daily average of about 110,000 customers per day — an increase over the approximately 32,000 average daily customers the airline served in April. 

Time Period | Domestic schedule reduction vs. same time period in 2019 | Avg Daily Passengers | Avg Load Factor  
---|---|---|---  
April 2020 | 65% | 32,154 | 15%  
May 1-23, 2020 | 80% | 78,718 | 41%  
May 24-29, 2020 | 80% | 110,330 | 55%  
  
Compared to the spring, American is increasing frequency of flying from hubs, including Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) to destinations customers are searching and booking most, with increased flying to major cities in Florida, Gulf Coast cities as well as mountain destinations. The airline also increased frequency of flying to Asheville, North Carolina (AVL), Savannah, Georgia (SAV), and Charleston, South Carolina (CHS) for business and leisure travelers. As the nation’s favorite theme parks begin to open, American will offer more seats to Florida than any other airline in July. American has also added more flying to mountain destinations in Montana, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming as national parks and outdoor recreational spaces reopen and customer demand for these destinations continues to recover. “We’re seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand. After a careful review of data, we’ve built a July schedule to match,” said Vasu Raja, American’s Senior Vice President of Network Strategy. “Our July schedule includes the smallest year-over-year capacity reduction since March. We’ll continue to look for prudent opportunities to restore service so our customers can travel whenever and wherever they are ready.” The July schedule will be reflected on [aa.com](http://aa.com/) and ready to purchase on Sunday, June 7. ## International Demand Slower to Return While international demand continued to be diminished, today marked the return of service to eight international destinations. These include service from Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) to Amsterdam (AMS), Paris (CDG) and Frankfurt (FRA), as well as service from Miami (MIA) to Antigua (ANU) in the Caribbean and Guayaquil (GYE) and Quito (UIO) in South America. American also restored additional service to London (LHR) from Chicago (ORD) and New York (JFK). American will delay the return of some previously [announced](http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Announces-Summer-Schedule-Changes-to-Match-Reduced-Customer-Demand-Related-to-COVID-19-OPS-DIS-04/default.aspx) international routes—including transatlantic service from Philadelphia (PHL) and CLT—to August.

American will continue robust cleaning procedures on all mainline departures, including expanded cleaning to disinfect seats, tray tables, seat buckles, air vents and other surfaces inside the aircraft. Other measures include electrostatic spraying of every surface of the interior of the aircraft, which eliminates 99.999% of viruses and bacteria within 10 minutes and creates a protective layer for up to seven days. All American mainline aircraft and most regional aircraft are equipped with onboard HEPA filters that provide a complete air change every two to four minutes, similar to the standard for hospitals. ## Book and Fly with Confidence: Increased Flexibility ### Customers offered options to rebook on fuller flights As demand for travel increases, American is deploying new tools to notify and allow customers booked on fuller flights to rebook on more open flights when available, all without incurring additional cost. On fuller eligible flights, a percentage of customers will be offered the option to rebook to a different flight during the check-in process. ### No change fees for flights booked by June 30 American Airlines is providing customers additional flexibility by expanding waived change fees for customers booking tickets for any new travel purchased by June 30, 2020.
