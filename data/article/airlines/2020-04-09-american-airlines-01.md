Given the significant decline in demand for travel to and from China, American will suspend travel between LAX and Shanghai Pudong Airport (PVG) as well as LAX and Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) from Feb. 9 through Mar. 27, 2020. American’s Reservations team will contact affected customers directly by email or telephone. We will continue to review our flight schedules to ensure we can accommodate the needs of our customers — and will make updates as needed.
