### Covid-19: Fast lane arrangements between Singapore and Mainland China Fast lanes arrangements have been established to facilitate essential business and official travel between Singapore and six provinces and municipalities in Mainland China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang), starting 8 June 2020. **Customers travelling from Mainland China to Singapore** Please note that for the first phase of the arrangements, only in-bound travellers to Singapore from China who are sponsored by government agencies may submit applications through their respective sponsors. Applications for company-sponsored travellers will open at a later date. To travel via these fast lanes, all travellers must have a negative Covid-19 test result certificate. In addition, customers travelling to Singapore are required to have a valid SafeTravel Pass, a return air ticket and a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders) for pre-boarding checks. Some provinces and municipalities may also require international arrivals into China to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon their return. **Customers travelling from Singapore to Mainland China** Residents of Singapore travelling to Mainland China should minimally have a negative Covid-19 test result certificate, valid visa and a Letter of Invitation. The application process, documents required and prevailing Covid-19 control measures may vary among the provinces and municipalities. Customers are encouraged to verify the latest requirements with the relevant authorities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning from China will need to serve a 14-day Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) upon entry into Singapore.
