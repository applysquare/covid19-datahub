The airline will reduce its planned systemwide capacity by 15 percent compared to what was previously scheduled. By region, reductions include: * 10-15 percent in domestic U.S. * 5 percent in Latin America * 15-20 percent in trans-Atlantic * 65 percent in trans-Pacific The airline’s priority is to ensure the safety and security of customers and employees, and it will continue adjusting service as necessary. Delta has also expanded its aircraft cleaning processes to include a [fogging procedure](https://news.delta.com/coronavirus-update-aircraft-fogging-enhances-customer-safety) that disinfects common surface areas with a safe, high-grade EPA-registered disinfectant highly effective against many communicable diseases, including coronaviruses. Following the fogging procedure, cleaning crews thoroughly clean cabin surfaces including tray tables, seatback screens, and lavatories.
