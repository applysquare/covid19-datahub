UPDATED May 5, 2020: The University System of Georgia is attempting to balance the needs of 26 unique institutions and has arrived at the decision they believe is best for the majority of students. Georgia Tech has extended the period to withdraw from courses until May 2 if students are concerned they will not pass the class. We have also asked faculty to be mindful of the situations students may face and work with them to provide help and guidance. If any student needs assistance with faculty or coursework, they should contact the Dean of Students Office so we can work with them on a case-by-case basis.
