Given the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the study and work away environment, to protect the safety of our students, their families and our partners, the University has decided to cancel all study exchanges and overseas work placements scheduled **to begin before 31 st July 2020**. If this affects you directly, please contact the [Study and Work Away Service](https://global.ed.ac.uk/study-work-away) for further guidance. 

This decision also includes all overseas group travel, field trips, summer school or placements that were due to take place before 31st July. However, this excludes programmes in CMVM and the School of Health and Social Sciences, which will continue due to prioritised medical and clinical requirements.

We are continually monitoring changes in travel restrictions and immigration policies and will review this guidance as required for exchanges and placements scheduled to take place after 31st July.
