Whether you remain at the University or are working from a distance, it is crucial that you continue to liaise with your supervisory team. As face-to-face meetings are no longer possible, it is important to discuss as to how best to maintain contact. The University has encouraged us to use [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/free).

It is important to recognise that the situation will not ease for a significant period of time, and may result in more stringent limitations; it is therefore important that in your discussions with your supervisors you look ahead over at least the next few months. 

If your lead supervisor is ill you should contact your second supervisor and your Director of Studies to discuss what arrangements need to be put in place for supervision of your project. 

### Impact on your studies

All students, whether or not they are able to continue with their studies, should keep a record of how COVID19 has affected your plans. This evidence will be crucial if you subsequently find that you need to extend your registration or seek an extension of your funding (subject to your funderâ€™s requirements). It is up to you how your record these details but it will be important to note any time spent having to redesign your work and on the duration of subsequent research activities.
