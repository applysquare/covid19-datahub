Dear Students,  
  
As the University closes the spring semester while planning for the months ahead, we write to share an update regarding emergency financial assistance for students.  
  
Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the University will receive and distribute funds to University of Miami students who have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These emergency funds will be distributed to students who have incurred expenses due to the disruption of campus operations, including eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care.  
  
The Department of Education has issued guidelines regarding the eligibility of students who may receive emergency financial aid grants under the CARES Act:

Funding is limited and it is our aim to assist those students in the greatest need. To expedite the distribution of emergency funds to students, the University will review applications and award funds on an ongoing basis until the funds are exhausted. Forms must be submitted by Wednesday, May 13, at 5 p.m., and the completion of the request form does not guarantee funding. Students will be notified of a decision via their miami.edu email account.
