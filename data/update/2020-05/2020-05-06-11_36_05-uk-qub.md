If you are unable or do not wish to undertake the assessment, you can inform your School in advance by completing the [COVID19 Alternative Assessment Student Deferral Form](https://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/AcademicStudentAffairs/AcademicAffairs/GeneralRegulations/SecureFilestore/Filetoupload,956888,en.doc). However, we understand that this may not always be possible. If an assessment is not submitted, we will assume that you were unable to submit. Your academic progression will then be considered as if you had chosen to defer the assessment.
