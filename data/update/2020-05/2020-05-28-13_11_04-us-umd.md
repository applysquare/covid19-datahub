_Associate Vice President for International Affairs Ross Lewin sent the following email to the campus community today:_

In light of the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to cancel all face-to-face study abroad programs for the Fall 2020 semester. This decision was made to prioritize the health and safety of our students, in coordination with the International Risk Management Committee and the provost.    
  
While we are not able to support study abroad for Fall 2020, we are working with academic units to design virtual opportunities for students to advance learning as global professionals, citizens and humanists, while continuing to advance them toward graduation. We will be adding an expanded list of global learning resources and opportunities [here](https://globalmaryland.umd.edu/offices/global/stay-global-umd-resources-global-engagement). I welcome further engagement from members of the campus community in program development.  
  
For now, students have been invited to explore summer internships and courses with UMD’s global partners or to enroll in one of UMD’s engaging Global Classrooms courses, through which they can work on impactful projects with international peers. Faculty members who are interested in learning more about Global Classrooms can contact Raluca Nahorniac at [raluca@umd.edu](mailto:raluca@umd.edu).  
  
Now more than ever, we need individuals who are actively involved in solving global problems and bringing out the best of humanity.

Thank you for your support.  
  
Best,  
  
Ross Lewin  
Associate Vice President for International Affairs
