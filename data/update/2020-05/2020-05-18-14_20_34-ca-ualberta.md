Over the last several weeks, the University of Alberta has been turning its attention to the Fall 2020 term. Today, President Turpin announced the U of A’s initial plans for welcoming incoming and current students to the new academic year in September.

Read the full message from President Turpin.

Highlights:

As always, our commitment is to provide a high-quality learning experience for our students, and to maximize university research and service activities.

At the same time, our top priority must be ensuring the health and safety of our community.

The majority of classes in Fall 2020 term will be delivered remotely and online.

Where possible, we are committed to providing small group and in-person learning.

We will continue to foster the fullest university life experience possible.

Residences will be available, based on public health guidelines.

Research will gradually resume as early as this month.

You can find more details in President Turpin’s Quad post today. As planning progresses and activities begin to resume, we will need to remain responsive to the changing conditions.

Updates will continue to be posted on this site as they become available.

Working Remotely

Today, most buildings on U of A campuses remain closed to the public. Currently, only employees who are required to maintain essential services or approved research are working on campus. All other employees should continue to work remotely. By the end of May, we will have guidelines in place to start the gradual and safe return of employees to campus as needed.

Adapting Courses

Need support adapting your course to online and remote deliver? The Centre for Teaching and Learning has supports for instructors and faculty. Please see available resources here.

Returning Research

A gradual, phased resumption of on-campus research activities will start as early as May 25. On-campus activities will be phased in slowly in order to comply with public health workplace requirements, avoid further stresses on in-demand resources, and safely manage our workspaces. Guidance to ensure safe working environments in preparation for our researchers to start resuming their activities on campus will be available shortly.

Guaranteed first year housing

Every fall, the U of A guarantees residence housing for our incoming class. This year, we’ve extended the application deadline to June 1. We also will have accommodation packages and supports for students, faculty and staff arriving from international locations who may need self-isolation. See Residence Services for more information.
