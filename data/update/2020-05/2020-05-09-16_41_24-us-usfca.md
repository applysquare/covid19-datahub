Effective May 1, 2020, USF is extending current travel restrictions on university-sponsored travel, international and domestic, in accordance with local and state directives and CDC and State Department advisories.

The following guidance applies through June 30, 2020:

USF travelers must defer all university-sponsored domestic and international travel through June 30, 2020 . We recognize that the need for essential travel may arise for members of the USF community. Requests for essential travel must be made in writing to the dean or supervisor and must be approved by the provost or the relevant cabinet member. Non-essential future travel should not be approved until further notice. Questions about travel to specific locations and geographic regions can be addressed to Anastasia Vrachnos, associate vice provost of international initiatives. We will review the situation and issue new guidance by June 30, 2020.

USF continues to urge all university community members to defer personal travel, domestic and international, in light of the spread of COVID-19 . This does not include travel of students who wish to return home . Those who need to travel should take into account health considerations for themselves or their families that make exposure to COVID-19 a higher risk and should be aware that the situation is changing rapidly. Travelers should be prepared for interruptions, unanticipated delays, and the need to quarantine, and should follow the advice and directives of local authorities in the states and countries to which they are traveling. Questions about personal travel can be directed to Anastasia Vrachnos.
