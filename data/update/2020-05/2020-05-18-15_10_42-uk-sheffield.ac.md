As previously advised, in light of the most recent advice from Public Health England, the University moved all teaching online from 16 March 2020. Library and other services are also available and do not require a VPN to access. While the present need to take these steps is the result of government advice to protect the health and wellbeing of staff and students due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and beyond our reasonable control, the University is committed to taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact on its students.

The University believes that the provision of such services online will enable it to continue the provision of learning opportunities and outcomes during this difficult time. We are confident that the steps we are taking are appropriate in the circumstances and will enable your continued progression on your degree unaffected. Therefore the University is not offering any tuition fee refunds in this context.
