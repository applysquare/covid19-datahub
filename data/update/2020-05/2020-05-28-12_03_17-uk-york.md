Covid-19 update - follow up on Gov announcement

Dear students

Following the UK Governmentâ€™s latest guidance on social distancing and lockdown restrictions, I am writing to give you an update on how we are approaching life on and off campus, now and in the near future.

I will also be sharing more details soon about the next academic year, because I know many of you are asking about your return to campus and the kind of educational experience you can expect.

Campus restrictions

At present, campus remains closed to all but essential members of staff who are there to provide support to those students who remain in University residences, and those undertaking Covid-related research and necessary estates maintenance.

The Government advice on easing of lockdown does not specifically reference universities except for mention of laboratories and research facilities. We are talking to other Russell Group universities, and taking advice from the UK Government Department for Education and Universities UK to inform our decisions and preparations for life back on campus.

Decisions on how we ease restrictions will be part of a safe and carefully managed plan, based on Government, sector, and industry guidelines and will include additional training or guidance for our staff and students.

We understand how frustrating this will be for many of our students, especially those who require access to labs or specialist resources and equipment, or who wish to return to collect personal belongings, and so our areas of immediate focus will include:

How to facilitate a planned and phased access to rooms on campus to enable students to collect personal belongings left in campus accommodation

How to manage requests for additional support to access campus to collect critical study items and equipment

How to bring our laboratories back into action safely

Our priority will remain the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff and students. We have colleagues across the institution working quickly to pull together this planning and we will update you with progress as soon as we can.

Best wishes

Charlie
