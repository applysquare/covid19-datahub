Dear Lions:

We miss you and we are grateful for your resilience and the many ways you continue to thrive amidst COVID-19 challenges. Your dedication to learning and caring for one another has warmed my heart and made me proud.

I know that you and your families are preparing for the fall 2020 semester, and our goal is to return to our campuses next semester, noting the clarifications and guidance below. Whatever circumstances exist in fall, instruction will continue so you can make progress toward your degree programs and pursue your academic ambitions.

Fall 2020 Semester



We look forward to welcoming you back to our campuses for in-person instruction, provided it is safe and aligns with guidance from public health authorities. While we are preparing contingency plans with appropriate protocols to protect the health and well-being of our community members, we are optimistic about what we can accomplish with prudent precautions in place.

For students impacted by travel restrictions or health concerns, we will provide accommodations so that disruptions to their educational experience are minimized.

We are modeling scenarios that are responsive to social distancing, sanitization requirements, and other conditions. Should circumstances require, we are considering a broad range of alternatives, such as adjusting the academic calendar, utilizing unconventional spaces and complementing classroom instruction with hybrid methodologies.

We will continue communicating with students and families regularly throughout the summer with further information. You can expect an update by May 27, 2020.

Please visit LMU’s Coronavirus Website for the latest updates.

Fall 2020 Student Housing



We currently anticipate opening residence halls and apartments for occupancy in the fall if it is safe and aligns with guidance from public health authorities. We will adhere to social distancing and other protocols. We are making every effort to accommodate returning students who’ve opted to live on campus and will continue to provide students with housing updates as public health authorities clarify guidelines.

We recommend that students living off campus review their lease terms with care. Many off-campus leases may not provide prorated refunds if terminated early. Alternatively, you might consider a month-to-month rental agreement rather than an annual lease. We encourage students to engage their landlords related to COVID-19 circumstances.

Preserving Our Strength



Last week, President Snyder announced interim measures the university has enacted to offset known revenue shortfalls in his Preserving Our Strength message. LMU’s senior leadership are proactively modeling a variety of scenarios that include potential budget savings and reductions to position the university optimally and to increase financial aid support for our students and families. We are and will continue considering various contingencies to ensure that the university remains strong, thriving, and responsive to quickly changing circumstances. Further information will be shared as appropriate.

CARES Act Relief Aid In Progress



The U.S. Department of Education confirmed that the university will receive COVID-19 aid and relief funding from the CARES Act, including emergency grants for students. More information will be forthcoming after funds are received from the federal government.

Deadline for Withdrawals and Credit/No Credit Extended to May 11



We have extended the deadline for withdrawals and to opt for credit/no credit grading to May 11, 2020, to provide students with flexibility as they manage this semester’s extenuating circumstances. To change to this option, please complete the form designated for your college or school for dean’s office approval.

Thank you again for navigating these uncharted waters with us. Guided by the spirit of the magis, and invigorated by the creativity, compassion, intelligence and love for LMU that you have shown over the past two months, I believe our community will be stronger than ever.

I look forward to seeing you again in the fall and hope you and your families stay healthy and safe.

With admiration,

Thomas Poon, Ph.D.

Executive Vice President and Provost
