If you're preparing to submit your PhD or MPhil thesis and/or undertake your viva or confirmation review, we have procedures in place to undertake these remotely using video conferencing if required; with approval from your faculty. Your supervisor will be able to discuss this with you, so please contact them in the first instance.
