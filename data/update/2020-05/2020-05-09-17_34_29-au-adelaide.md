On 14 April, the University of Adelaide made the decision to suspend non-essential student travel until the end of 2020. As it stands, Faculty Approval, for programs commencing on or after 1 January 2021 can be considered from 1 August 2020, however, these dates will be reviewed by 6 July 2020 in order to assess the situation in case further extension is required.
