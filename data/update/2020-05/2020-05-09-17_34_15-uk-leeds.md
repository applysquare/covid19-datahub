During this time of upheaval we have decided to send the newsletter out on a more regular basis.

The Leeds Doctoral College Newsletter is emailed to all postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and members of the Doctoral College, and is published as an announcement on the Leeds Doctoral College Organisation on Minerva( https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/ ) and students.ac.uk( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10112/research_degrees/1103/doctoral_college_newsletters ) Past editions can be requested via email. 

UPDATES

For the latest general advice, please check the latest news on our dedicated coronavirus website and PGR FAQs( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/ )

There is also an archive of the coronavirus updates sent to students( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/student-communications/ )

New Virtual Windows Desktop  IT is launching a new Virtual Windows Desktop. This will initially give you access to M and N Drives and any websites that are normally only available on campus (e.g. Library resources). The service is being developed rapidly, and more applications will be added over the next few weeks. If you have a staff account, you will already have access to this; if you have a student account you will have access soon. This will eventually be a replacement for Desktop Anywhere. Find out how to get started on the IT website 

May Bank Holiday The University will be closed (which at the moment means we’re all still at home, but not working!) on the 8 May for the May Day/VE Day bank holiday. We will reopen on Monday 11 May.

Please keep in touch with your supervisor/s and continue to maintain your GRAD record. We are asking PGRs whose work is affected by the current circumstances in any way (e.g. lack of access to facilities, inability to carry out fieldwork, caring duties, etc.) to document this in a ‘supervision meeting’ record on GRAD so that your supervisors are aware and so that we can take this into account should we need to in future. If your circumstances change in any way, or you have any concerns, please contact your Graduate School( http://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/130206/applying/124/graduate_school_contacts ) – all teams are working from home but still available on emails.

Please do get in touch with the Doctoral College( mailto:doctoralcollege@leeds.ac.uk ) if there is anything more that you need to know. 

Your safety and wellbeing are our priority.

Interdisciplinary Research Development - methods and approaches In this series, people will share their approaches and methods of research in a way that is accessible to a wide audience. There are three aims:
1.use intellectual conversations to build collaborations across disciplines 
2.build new and novel networks
3.explore new project ideas 

This first seminar on 7 May 11.30-12.30 will be led by three academics who have been through this process: Dr Elizabeth Duncan( https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/school-of-biology/staff/59/dr-elizabeth-duncan ), Dr Chris Hassall( https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/school-of-biology/staff/79/dr-christopher-hassall ), Dr Ryan Neely III( https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1447/dr-ryan-neely-III ). This led to the development of a large NERC grant. Future seminars will be focussed on approaches and methods with an open outcome. Please contact Joanne Sutherland( https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/id/j.sutherland@leeds.ac.uk ), who will send you the online joining details.
