Core modules – those modules that must be taken and passed, as opposed to compulsory modules, which must be taken but can be failed or condoned – must still be passed, as they are, by nature, fundamental to their respective programmes. However, the marks of a core module that has been passed can still be excluded for the purpose of calculating your year average or award classification, where any core modules are among the 30 credits with the lowest marks.

Read the undergraduate award rules or PGT award rules for more information about potentially excluding some low marks from affecting your classification.
