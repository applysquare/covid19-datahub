Dear Faculty and Staff,

We want to send you an update on our plans for Summer 2020. Given the current uncertainty and the likelihood that the pandemic will continue to be disruptive through the late spring and into the summer, Clark University will offer all Summer 2020 courses online. (Summer I and Summer II) This decision provides a level of certainty for our students participating in summer courses and provides the faculty time to more adequately prepare their courses for an online delivery. Clark’s traditional summer offering include courses from SOM, IDCE, SPS, SPS-Undergrad, Education and ALCI.

This week, Academic Technology Services, under the leadership of Joanne Dolan, launched a 6-week course/program created specifically to help faculty get courses up and running for summer. All faculty who will be teaching this summer whose courses have not yet been developed online have been asked to enroll in this course. Courses in the American Language and Culture Institute will follow a modified online development model. Details on Summer Session can be found at https://www.clarku.edu/schools/sps/programs/summer-session.

Registration for Summer courses at Clark begins on April 22, 2020.

Stay well and take care!

The Provost’s Office
