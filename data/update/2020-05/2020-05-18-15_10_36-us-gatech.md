  * In- and out-of-state rates still apply and are based on the studentsâ€™ residency status.
  * Out-of-state students who were registered to participate in faculty-led study abroad (FLSA) programs, or who were slated to attend Georgia Tech Lorraine (GTL), in summer 2020 will pay the lower tuition rates based on the program they planned to attend.  For FLSA programs, this is the in-state tuition rate.  For GTL students, this is in the in-state tuition rate plus $5,000. 
  * All mandatory/course fees have been eliminated with the exception of the Special Institutional Fee and Technology Fee.     
  * If a student qualifies for the Mandatory Student Health Insurance premium, they will still be charged the premium for summer and they can apply for a waiver if they have other comparable insurance.
