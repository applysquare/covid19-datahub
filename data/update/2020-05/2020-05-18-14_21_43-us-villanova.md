May 12, 2020

Dear Members of the Villanova Community,

On Friday, May 15, we will officially end our spring semesterâ€”a semester unlike any in our history. At 4:30 p.m., we will confer degrees to our undergraduate, graduate and law students via an online ceremony for the first time ever. While it cannot compare to our traditional celebration on campus, it will be a heartfelt and memorable occasion to mark the accomplishments of the Villanova University Class of 2020.

I encourage you to join the celebration, which will be streamed on commencement.villanova.edu. While our roles may be different, every member of the Villanova community has played a part in helping these students reach this momentous time in their lives. I know it would mean a great deal to the students and their families, particularly given our current situation, if you were able to join us.

Additionally, as you are aware, May 15 customarily would be the first of our Summer Fridays. On these designated Fridays, full-time staff employees have the opportunity for early dismissal. Unfortunately, given the various disruptions to operations caused by COVID-19, I regret that I am unable to offer Summer Hours this year. It is my hope that this benefit, along with all of our other operations, will return to normal when this pandemic is behind us.

Sincerely,
