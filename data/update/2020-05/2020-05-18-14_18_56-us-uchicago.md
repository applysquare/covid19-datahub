Email from Provost Ka Yee C. Lee (May 8, 2020)

From: Ka Yee C. Lee, Provost

Subject: COVID-19â€™s Impact on Summer Programs



I am writing with additional information about planning for summer programs in light of safety precautions related to COVID-19.

Maintaining the health and safety of our community is paramount, and as such it is vital for University programs to coordinate with their deans and officers before making plans to resume any on-campus activities that had been suspended as a result of the pandemic. It is important to bear in mind that any resumption of activities on campus will be done gradually over the course of months, with guidance and input from medical and public health officials.

Regarding summer activities, this means:

Summer programs that were scheduled to begin on campus prior to July 15 should be adapted for remote delivery, postponed, or cancelled. This includes all regular summer session courses, study abroad opportunities, as well as numerous other programs that typically would be hosted at our Hyde Park or downtown Chicago campuses.

We plan to provide an update by the end of May concerning on-campus programs that have been scheduled to begin after July 15.

Thank you for your understanding. We look forward to communicating again soon about planning for this summer and fall.
