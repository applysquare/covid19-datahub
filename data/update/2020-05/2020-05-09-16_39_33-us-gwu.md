Dear 2020 graduates,

Congratulations on nearing the end of finals and reaching the culmination of your time at GW. We are so proud of all you have achieved and want to celebrate with you at the Virtual Commencement Celebration on Sunday, May 17 at 11:00 a.m. E.T. Please invite your family and friends to join us for an online ceremony that will connect our GW community currently scattered across the globe.

We also encourage you to share a message with your graduating class. Submit a short video or photo by Friday, May 8 at 5:30 p.m. E.T. for the chance to be featured in the virtual ceremony. This can entail sharing a favorite memory or #OnlyatGW moment, congratulating the Class of 2020, thanking family, friends and faculty, or any message of your choosing.

We look forward to celebrating with you on Sunday, May 17, and officially welcoming you into our worldwide network of GW alumni. The Virtual Commencement Celebration will be shared on GWâ€™s Facebook page and posted to commencement.gwu.edu beginning at 11:00 a.m. E.T.

Raise High,

M. Brian Blake
