What are the plans for construction that was suspended and the programs and offices that were supposed to be moving into those spaces?

MIT is awaiting notification from the City of Cambridge regarding a date when construction will be allowed to proceed. In accordance with a temporary emergency construction moratorium instituted by the City of Cambridge, MIT suspended construction activities effective Saturday, March 21, with the exception of some emergency activities that have been approved to proceed by the city. While we await news from the city, MIT’s construction management teams are developing site protocols to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the construction workers and members of our community during the time of Covid-19. These new protocols will impact the pace of construction, and we are developing scheduling scenarios that will take into account these factors once the plans have been finalized and approved by the city. As we work on these plans, we are in contact with the offices who were scheduled to move into these spaces. We will share more information once the city establishes a date for ramping up construction work.

During this time, the sites are being monitored to maintain safety and security. Note that this moratorium only affects the construction phase of these projects and that planning and design activities continue. In addition, staff who provide repair and maintenance services continue to be available on campus and will work within the city’s guidelines to provide approved emergency repairs as needed.
