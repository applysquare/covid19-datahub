Reminder: Aid Opportunities for Students in Need

May 6, 2020

Dear members of our Saint Louis University community,

On Friday, I shared that our COVID-19 Relief Request Application is now live and we are actively working to connect federal stimulus aid to our students in need. More than 1,600 students have submitted applications thus far, but we believe there could be many others who haven’t applied but could benefit from these relief funds.

We strongly encourage all students who have faced financial challenges due to the pandemic to fill out the application. Even if you are not eligible for a grant through the CARES Act funding, we might be able to connect you with grant awards through our student emergency fund, or other forms of institutional aid.

There are two ways we are distributing grants using the $2.57 million in CARES Act funding. The first was an automatic $300-$500 grant to students with an Estimated Family Contribution below $12,000 from the 2019-20 FAFSA. Those electronic refunds are processing right now to eligible students and paper checks will be mailed out today to those who didn’t have a refund account on file.

The second grant option is based on financial needs identified through the application to address expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. We are working hard to process these applications in real time. This grant option could help cover a range of expenses, including (but not limited to):

Food

Housing and moving expenses (e.g. rent, storage)

Technology (e.g. internet, routers, computers, cameras, software)

Transportation (e.g. unexpected travel costs)

Child care

Medical expenses

Increased utility costs

Roughly 70 percent of COVID-19 Relief Request applicants indicated that either they or their parents have lost their job. That is a devastating statistic, and one that reminds us how critical it is that we make funding decisions quickly and with care.

Know that we are here for you. We are OneSLU.

Sincerely,

David Heimburger

Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
