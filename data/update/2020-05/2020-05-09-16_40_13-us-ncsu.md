NC State Community,

Late this afternoon, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper announced updated plans for a phased-in reopening of our state’s economy with the continued encouragement for citizens to work from home, and stay at home, as much as possible. As outlined in the Governor’s new executive order, Phase One of the plan lifts some statewide restrictions beginning Friday, May 8, at 5 p.m., and is expected to last for 2-3 weeks.

As NC State moves forward and begins implementing plans for reactivating on-campus operations and activities, our top priority in all decisions will continue to be the health, safety and well-being of our Wolfpack community. Our university will follow all state orders and UNC System guidance, as well as CDC guidelines to help ensure a safe on-campus environment.

Continue Current Operations Until Otherwise Notified

While the stay-at-home order for North Carolina is being modified and the state is moving into its next phase of reopening, we expect the majority of NC State’s workforce to continue working remotely until further notice.

To help protect the health and safety of the campus population, at this time only mandatory on-site employees should be on campus as directed by their supervisor.

Over the next several days, Provost Warwick Arden and Vice Chancellor Charles Maimone will provide the campus community more detailed information about plans to begin reopening the university in critical areas, which will enable more employees to return to on-campus work.

Phasing in On-Campus Operations

The following areas have been prioritized to begin reactivation of limited on-campus operations and activities:



Research

Extension

Veterinary Hospital

Industrial Expansion Solutions

Talley Student Union (both bookstore and some food service for takeout)

Select Facilities operations and maintenance

Environmental Health and Safety

In all cases, on-campus work schedules and work areas will be adapted, where possible, to ensure physical distancing of employees, and precautions such as face masks will be recommended. The university will provide face masks and hand sanitizer to all on-campus employees. Any gatherings will be limited to 10 people or less with appropriate physical distancing.

Personnel required to support campus in these areas of reactivation should expect to return to campus, when notified, in limited capacities.

One Pack

As we come to the close of the spring semester, I want to thank you all for your tremendous dedication and hard work on behalf of NC State. Our Wolfpack community has shown great innovation, collaboration and compassion in adapting to new and changing conditions.

Moving into our next phase of operations, please continue to do all you can to keep yourself, your loved ones and your Pack healthy and strong. Thank you for your commitment to NC State, and I look forward to reactivating campus operations alongside you in a safe manner.

Thank you,

Randy Woodson, Chancellor
