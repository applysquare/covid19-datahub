We will not be recording attendance to scheduled teaching activities from Monday 23 March, so there will be no impact on your Tier 4 status. We will continue to sponsor your Tier 4 visa during this period, even if you return to your home country, so your visa will remain valid. You can use it to return to the UK at a later date if you wish to do so, as long as this is before the date that your current visa expires.
