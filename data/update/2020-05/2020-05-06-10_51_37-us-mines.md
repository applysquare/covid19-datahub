From the President’s Office: Mines Extending Remote Work Operations Through May 8, 2020

The following message was sent to the Mines campus on 4/24/20:

Dear Campus Community:

Earlier today, Jefferson County Public Health, along with other Denver Metro Counties, extended the State’s Stay-at-Home order through May 8, 2020. Consistent with those orders, Colorado School of Mines is extending its remote work operations through May 8, 2020.

Additional details for operational status beyond May 8 will be forthcoming based on state and local guidance.
