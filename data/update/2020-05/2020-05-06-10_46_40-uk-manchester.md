It can be frustrating studying from home and not having access to your usual services in person, but that doesn’t mean we’ve gone away. Our services are still running and we still have real people and real support you can access no matter where in the world you are.

The Library

The Library is still very much open online, with new resources and study support going live on their website all the time. They have an online chat facility – which you can access from that orange box on the right hand side of their website – that is staffed 24/7, meaning you can chat about specific library services or get general questions answered by real people.

Careers Service

The Careers Service is also working harder than ever to accommodate students from home, and you can still book online careers appointments, access online workshops and online skills and training. They also have a chat facility that’s open during 9am-5pm Monday – Friday – you can access it on the right hand side of their website here.

IT Services

IT Services are also here to help if you’re having difficulties accessing the University network, or need advice and support with accessing online services. Students that need additional help or are going without equipment that they need can send their queries and details to helpmegetonline@manchester.ac.uk for assistance.

The Students’ Union

Your SU is also very much open for business, and are still actively supporting you through the coming months. While you can’t access their services in person, their Advice Team are available to contact by emailing advice.su@manchester.ac.uk with a summary of your enquiry, a contact telephone number as well as your course information.

Manchester Student Homes

The Manchester Student Homes team is currently working remotely to deliver services for students, and all specialists are still accessible by email and by phone. They’re on hand to respond to issues in the community or answer any queries regarding to renting and letting properties through their website or elsewhere.

Living Support Fund

While this one isn’t a service exactly, the University understands that Coronavirus may cause some students to struggle to meet their day to day living costs and have ways to support you. We want as many students as possible to be able to continue with their studies, so the Living Cost Support Fund is available to assist eligible students in overcoming financial hardship – here’s the information you need.
