Students may claim for extenuating circumstances in the usual way. However, in addition to the usual grounds for ECs students may claim on the grounds of employment and/or caring responsibilities (there are usually limitations on those grounds), and on a lack of appropriate equipment or technology to complete assessments. Household circumstances (such as a lack of private space in which to undertake an alternative assessment) will also constitute an EC for assessment.

Additionally, students may self-certify for assessments during the current situation, i.e. a student does not need to supply any supporting evidence for an EC claim to be accepted (but must still submit the claim itself, in the usual manner). (This is in accordance with a direct instruction from the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.)
