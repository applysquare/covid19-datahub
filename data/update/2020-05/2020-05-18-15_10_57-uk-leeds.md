During this time of upheaval we have decided to send the newsletter out on a more regular basis. 

The Leeds Doctoral College Newsletter is emailed to all postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and members of the Doctoral College, and is published as an announcement on the Leeds Doctoral College Organisation on Minerva( https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/ ) and students.ac.uk( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10112/research_degrees/1103/doctoral_college_newsletters ) Past editions can be requested via email. 

UPDATES

For the latest general advice, please check the latest news on our dedicated coronavirus website and PGR FAQs( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/postgraduate-researcher-faqs/ ). There is also an archive of the coronavirus updates( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/student-communications/ ) sent to students.

Extensions, funding and Covid-19
Prof. Claire Honess and Prof. Lisa Roberts emailed all PGRS on 7 May( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2020/05/Message-sent-from-Professor-Lisa-Roberts-and-Professor-Claire-Honess-on-7-May.docx ), detailing the University’s policies on extensions, overtime periods and funding for those impacted by the Covid-19 situation. Emails have also been sent to all research council and school/faculty/university funded PGRs; if you fall into one of these groups and have not received an email, please contact your Graduate School( http://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/130206/applying/124/graduate_school_contacts ).

Keep in touch

Please make regular contact with your supervisor/s and continue to maintain your GRAD record. We are asking PGRs whose work is affected by the current circumstances in any way (e.g. lack of access to facilities, inability to carry out fieldwork, caring duties, etc.) to document this in a ‘supervision meeting’ record on GRAD so that your supervisors are aware and so that we can take this into account should we need to in future. If your circumstances change in any way, or you have any concerns, please contact your Graduate School – all teams are working from home but still available on emails.

Please get in touch with the Doctoral College( mailto:doctoralcollege@leeds.ac.uk ) if there is anything more that you need to know. 

Your safety and wellbeing are our priority.

Society for Military History prize
John William Sutcliffe IV (PGR in the School of History) has been awarded the 2020 CSIS Graduate Student Prize in Applied Military History, from the Society for Military History.

Structural Biology vs Covid-19
Alex Holmes, a PGR in the Astbury Centre, has written about the structural biology of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins( https://pintofscience.co.uk/blog/the-improtance-of-proteins-in-covid-19/ ) for the Pint of Science blog. Alex is involved in a wide range of public engagement projects and also recently featured in a profile by @colourmephd( https://twitter.com/colormephd/status/1248276680373874688 ), a project which creates free educational colouring pages communicating PhD research in science and engineering.

Research Nights
Sadly, we are not able to run our usual Research Nights, but we didn’t want it to stop. So in lieu of regular Research Nights taking place in Pyramid in LUU, we would like to invite you to join us for the monthly #ResearchNightsIn coming soon to Twitter, showcasing some of the fascinating research being conducted by you! If you would like to take part by creating a short video to explain your research or a fun fact from your area, just email Doctoral College  to express your interest. It’s a great opportunity to test the waters and develop skills in online engagement.

RESEARCH SKILLS AND CAREERS

New courses from ODPL
Two new resources have been added to the Doctoral College Organisation in Minerva. 

A balancing act: dealing with the stresses of doing a research degree( https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_474527_1&content_id=_7256013_1&mode=reset ).
This course offers a range of advice and links to resources to help balance the stresses around a research degree. This has been put together by the University student counselling service, based upon the experiences of their long running face to face workshop, and is specifically for postgraduate researchers. It may be particularly useful in the current context.

Engaging the UK Parliament with your research( https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_474527_1&content_id=_7256741_1&mode=reset )
This self-study guide looks at the routes that you can take to get your research into the UK Parliament. 

New ‘Shut Up and Write! For Postgraduates and Staff’  
These sessions offer a framework and supportive environment for you to focus on your own work.
Online sessions are now available:  
Thursday 14 May 1pm-3.30pm
