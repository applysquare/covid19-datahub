Typically, candidates need to apply for program leave by the Term census date, which was 13 March for Term 1 2020. However, if you are unable to conduct your research due to COVID-19 and you would like to apply for program leave for Term 1 2020, please email the [Candidature Management Officer (link is external)](https://research.unsw.edu.au/graduate-research-school-contacts)for your Faculty as soon as possible for information on how to lodge a retrospective request for Program Leave.  

If you wish to apply for Program Leave in Term 2 or Term 3 2020 you can do so via [GRIS(link is external)](https://www.gris.unsw.edu.au/login). The deadline to apply for program leave for Term 2 is 28 June 2020, and the deadline for Term 3 is 11 October 2020. For more information on Term dates, please visit the [HDR Academic Calendar(link is external)](https://research.unsw.edu.au/hdr-academic-calendar).  

Please be aware that your scholarship will be suspended while youâ€™re on leave and you should not be working on your research during that time. If you have any questions about program leave, please contact the Candidature Management Officer for your Faculty.
