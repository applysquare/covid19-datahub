All summer 2020 graduation ceremonies are postponed until further notice.

This decision was made so that we have a longer academic year in which to ensure the successful completion of our students’ education.

SUSU has decided to cancel all of its upcoming large-scale events taking place in the summer term.

This includes AU Ball, WSA Ball, Academic Awards, Society & Volunteering Awards and Grad Ball.

Those of you who have already bought tickets for WSA Ball and Grad Ball will be refunded automatically (you don’t need to worry about contacting SUSU) in due course.
