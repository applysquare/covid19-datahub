Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

This week’s Monday update summarizes the current status in North Carolina and at the university, offers an update on summer at Elon, and provides important information for the conclusion of the undergraduate semester.

**Current status**

  * There have been [11,848 laboratory-confirmed cases](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc) of COVID-19 in the [state of North Carolina](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina), including 128 in Alamance County.  A total of 430 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.
  * There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Elon students, faculty, or staff who have been on campus during a possible period of contagion. The university will continue to report positive cases in accordance with county, state, national and international guidelines. Students on campus or in the area with symptoms that may indicate COVID-19 will be referred for testing using county and state protocols and may be advised to self-isolate to protect the health and safety of the community.
  * The North Carolina [stay-at-home executive order](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf) has been [extended](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO135-Extensions.pdf) until this Friday, May 8. Governor Cooper has also announced a three-phase plan for [reopening businesses](https://governor.nc.gov/news/governor-extends-stay-home-order-through-may-8-plans-three-phase-lifting-restrictions-based) in  North Carolina. Elon employees received [initial information today](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/guidelines-for-physical-distancing-and-hygiene/) from Kelli Shuman, associate vice president for Human Resources, about plans for Elon employees to begin returning to work on campus over the coming weeks.



**Commencement and degree conferral ceremonies**

  * Undergraduate seniors and their families have received information about the online [Conferral Ceremony](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/05/03/elon-to-host-online-conferral-ceremony-for-the-undergraduate-class-of-2020-on-may-22/), scheduled for May 22 to honor seniors and recognize the completion of their degrees. This ceremony will not replace in-person Commencement exercises which are anticipated to be held on campus later this year on a date still to be determined.
  * Additionally, the Master of Arts in Interactive Media Commencement ceremony and the Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Accounting and Master of Science in Business Analytics Commencement ceremony have also been postponed, and online ceremonies for conferral of degrees will begin May 20.
  * The Master of Arts in Higher Education ceremony will be held as planned on May 20, for the 14 members of the inaugural graduating class and streamed for family and friends.  
Information for Commencement 2020, including online degree conferral ceremonies  can be found on the [Commencement website](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/).



**Spring semester information for undergraduates**

  * Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on campus currently, it does not mean there may not be students who are asymptomatic or with very mild cases. In these instances the  student infected may not realize they are ill or putting others in danger. We continue to urge those students returning to campus to pick up belongings in the coming weeks to follow appropriate health guidance, offered in previous communications. Most notably, we continue to recommend that students should not return to campus to reunite with friends, host gatherings, or remain on campus longer than necessary – one night at most. Information related to moving out of on-campus residences can be found on the Residence Life website [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/residence-life/moveout2020/).
  * The due date for spring **textbooks rentals** has been extended to June 15. Please visit the Elon Bookstore website [here](https://elon.bncollege.com/shop/elon/page/rental-book-return) to generate a FREE return label to ship rentals back to the bookstore.  The form will expire after the June 15 due date.  The final charge date for non-returned rental fees will be August 25. Barnes & Noble is offering remote **textbook buyback** for students to sell back non-rented textbooks at the end of the semester.  A FREE shipping label is included. The link can be located on the [bookstore website](https://elon.bncollege.com/shop/elon/home) or directly linked [here](https://onlinebuyback.mbsbooks.com/index.php?ACTION=home&CSID=A3JJAZC2AAQZCQOATQM2UAWMB&jde=10380637). Be sure to contact Carly Mayer, Bookstore Manager, with any questions at cmayer4@elon.edu.

**Planning for Fall Semester**

President Book has appointed a Task Force on Fall Semester 2020, made up of faculty, staff and students, to create a comprehensive plan to resume on-campus instruction and residence life this fall. The task force began its work immediately and formed three working groups involving many consultants from the campus community. The task force will make its recommendations by May 27.
