All assessments, excluding those that will be replaced by coursework assignments, will be offered in a 24 hour period – either of no fixed duration, or a fixed duration. This will allow you to complete the exams at a suitable time, wherever you may be. The 24 hour period exists to allow all students to engage with the assessment no matter in which time zone you are living. To repeat, there is no expectation that these assessments should take longer than ‘normal’ examinations.
