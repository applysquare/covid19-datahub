From the President’s Office: COVID-19 Remote Work Update

The following message was sent to all Mines employees and graduate students on 5/20/20:

Dear Colleagues,

As we approach 30 days since “Safer at Home” guidelines from the Department of Higher Education went into effect, I am writing to update you on our plans to further extend remote work assignments for many of you this summer while continuing to facilitate the careful return to campus for others after May 26, 2020.

Any decisions that have or will be made balance the fact COVID-19 is still widespread throughout the Front Range while at the same time understanding that some members of our community require access to our campus for work, research or education.

Remote Work Status Update:

Employees who are still able to work remotely should plan to continue to do so until June 30, unless otherwise notified by your supervisor as authorized by a vice president or dean. For many, we anticipate this status will be extended for the rest of the summer, but others will be needed to work on campus as some Summer II classes may be conducted on campus and we begin preparations for Fall semester.

The research office, deans, and others are working on plans to be able to gradually increase access to research facilities for faculty, research faculty and students with most authorization granted via academic departments. We anticipate being able to communicate more about this plan and accompanying procedures within the next two weeks. Until those plans are announced the process for accessing research laboratories will remain the same.

Employees who have not been able to conduct their responsibilities remotely will work with supervisors and respective vice presidents and deans to determine the timing and how best to return to campus safely.

Employees are still able to access campus buildings to support remote teaching or remote work but should limit trips to campus and their length of stay in buildings. Access to all campus buildings will remain via Blastercard or key only – even during regular business hours.

Special Considerations:

Per state order, vulnerable employees cannot be compelled to perform in-person work, and those employees who live with vulnerable persons should be provided remote work or alternate work schedules to the greatest extent possible.

Mines also expects supervisors to be flexible and understanding of the unique challenges presented by the pandemic, and the challenges employees may experience as they work remotely including juggling child care and work. This is especially acute this summer given the cancellation of most summer camps and programs. For further guidance and resources on FFRCRA or supervisor considerations visit Human Resources’s COVID-19 website.

Pandemic Recovery Planning:

Key to bringing more people to campus is implementing health and safety procedures, increasing the availability of protective equipment, such as cloth masks and cleaning and disinfectant supplies, and making safety adjustments to buildings and workspaces such as adding plexiglass barriers to high-contact areas (as being done in many area grocery stores). As President Johnson noted in his message last week, numerous groups are working to prepare Mines for August 2020 and to ensure safety to support any increased activity on campus this summer.

We will continue to provide Friday updates on our campus safety measures as well as decisions yet to come related to topics like travel and events. As always, should state officials issue stricter guidance we will modify our operating procedures to follow those orders.

Finally, we continue to require that all faculty, staff, and students wear face coverings when on campus. Evidence continues to grow on the importance of wearing face coverings from countries who have successfully decreased the spread of COVID-19. Additional requirements are also detailed on our Required Procedures for Working on Campuswebsite.

Thank you again for all you are doing under these difficult circumstances, and I hope you enjoy the Memorial Day weekend.
