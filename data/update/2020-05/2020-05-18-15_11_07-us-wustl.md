OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR

Greetings to the Washington University Class of 2020 and your families, It’s your Commencement week! Congratulations on getting to this point in your WashU journey. Though we wish we could celebrate together on campus, we look forward to coming together virtually later this week. Before then, I wanted to share this video message about our postponed in-person Commencement plans as I know many of you have been eager to hear the news.

Please know how personally excited I am to share this news with you, and thank you again for your patience as we’ve worked to finalize these details. Though we still have a little over a year before our in-person celebration, remember that this week still marks your official graduation from Washington University, and you should feel immensely proud of this moment and all you’ve accomplished. Once again, we are eager to honor you during our virtual ceremonies( https://mailingsresponse.wustl.edu/trk/click?ref=z1030up2e7_2-11243x318cbax0613& ) later this week, and we look forward to seeing you carry the Washington University ethos wherever you go as you begin this exciting new chapter.

Sincerely,

Chancellor Martin

Andrew D. Martin
CHANCELLOR
