Dear Miami Community,

With the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff always our top priority, we, like many universities, have decided to offer all summer classes online/remotely. During this time, we will be actively engaging the campus community to plan for safely returning to campus for fall.

Summer’s online classes will follow the typical, posted summer session schedule(s) — May 19, 2020–August 8, 2020. We will also return to our typical grading practices and deadlines. For example, students will have the ability to select credit/no credit grading but only during the early part of the session.

I want to thank the entire Miami community again for adapting to this quick shift in the way we learn and teach and for continuing Miami’s educational mission during this pandemic crisis.

In the meantime, we all look forward to a full campus come fall.

Stay safe and stay well.

Love and Honor,  
Jason Osborne
