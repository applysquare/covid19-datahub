Monday, May 11, 2020 - 5:45 p.m.

Consider this your personal invitation to join an event that will become a part of Rice history.

Rice’s first virtual commencement ceremony goes live online Saturday, May 16. The Class of 2020 will be celebrated in a series of presentations honoring recipients of undergraduate, advanced and doctoral degrees.

Our virtual commencement ceremonies will be carried simultaneously at commencement.rice.edu as well as on the university’s Facebook page and YouTube channel. The event begins with the advanced degrees ceremony at 11 a.m. CDT, followed by the doctoral ceremony at 1 p.m. and the undergraduate ceremony at 3 p.m.

If you aren’t able to watch the ceremonies live, the videos will remain on Rice’s commencement page — as well as Facebook and YouTube — for viewers to enjoy on their own and share with others.

Rice plans to celebrate the Class of 2020 with an in-person ceremony on campus at a future date that’s still to be determined. In the meantime, we hope you’ll join us this weekend for the virtual commencement honoring the 107th graduating class of Rice University.
