Dear Campus Recreation patron,

Thank you for your patience as we work through the process of making account adjustments. Campus Recreation will be providing refunds to undergraduate, graduate, faculty/staff, associate and alumni recreation members as follows:

Prorated membership fee for 8 weeks of the spring semester

Pre-paid summer membership fee

Pre-paid summer locker fee

Remaining/unused personal training sessions purchased in the spring semester

For patrons who had recreation membership fees via payroll deduction, the final payroll deduction occurred in the March 20 paycheck; refunds will only apply for pre-paid summer locker rental and/or remaining spring personal training sessions.

Campus Recreation is also coordinating with administrators regarding Graduate Employee Organization (GEO) members who have received reimbursement through the UAW/UMass Health and Welfare Trust Fund. Refunds for those graduate employees who have already been reimbursed by the Trust Fund will be credited back to their Trust Fund accounts at hwtrust.geouaw.org and will be available for additional reimbursement according to the new guidelines at www.uawumasstrustfund.org/geo-wellness.

Campus Recreation will provide an update regarding your account adjustment in the near future. Thank you again for your patience.

Sincerely,

Patricia A. Shea
