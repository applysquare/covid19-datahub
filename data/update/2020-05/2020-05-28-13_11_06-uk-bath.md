# Read the University's guides to taking your exams

Before and during your assessments you will need to read:

  * [The Student Guide to Assessment: 2019/20 Semester 2 assessment period](/guides/student-guide-to-assessment-2019-20-semester-2-assessment-period/) summarises how to approach online assessment, including what types of assessments you might be expected to take, how to prepare for an off-campus exam, and wellbeing advice. We suggest you download a copy of the PDF to have handy in case of any internet connectivity issues.

  * Instructions on how to [prepare and submit your alternative assessment through Moodle, and other platforms](https://teachinghub.bath.ac.uk/teaching-online-options-and-considerations/support-for-students-alternative-assessment/).




You should also access the [Exams Schedule](/guides/assessment-period-timetable-summer-2020/) to confirm when your assessment will take place.

# What to do if you have IT difficulties

If you have difficulty connecting to Moodle, Re:View or MS Teams during an assessment, please check whether these services, and Single Sign-On, are currently operational at [University of Bath IT status](https://status.bath.ac.uk/).

If you need IT support and advice before or during an assessment you should submit an [IT support enquiry online](https://www.bath.ac.uk/services/submit-an-it-support-enquiry-online/).

# What to do if you have any other difficulties (i.e. not IT)

If anything else is preventing you from completing your assessment, please contact us using [the Assessment Helpline form](https://bath.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=6912a3c805774906a8a136a5751b18e9&openedFromService=true). Please include details of the affected unit or the exam code, and your issue.
