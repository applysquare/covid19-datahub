Our approach is designed to ensure that students are not detrimentally affected by the circumstances of Covid-19. 

We are doing this firstly by removing Summer Term (Term 3) examinations as far as possible so that your progression or award is based on the assessment that you have carried out prior to Summer Term, including in previous years where applicable. We believe that these marks, obtained during the period before Covid-19, provide the most accurate indication of a student’s performance. We hope that removing exams will also help to alleviate anxiety amongst students.

Secondly, for all assessments undertaken since the suspension of classroom teaching, Exam Boards will have additional checks in place to ensure that any adverse effects are taken into account when considering students' results. You do not need to submit an ‘exceptional circumstances’ claim as all Exam Boards will be taking the situation into account in determining your results. Thirdly, to maximise the chance for students to succeed we are adapting our degree regulations used when calculating degree results to ensure that borderline cases are viewed favourably while maintaining quality.
