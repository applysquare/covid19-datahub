### All students 

**TOEFL iBT Home Edition**

We have approved the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition online test for entry to the University of Edinburgh. This test is available in many countries around the world, and can be taken online from your home.

Entry requirements based on the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition test are exactly the same as the entry requirements for the standard TOEFL iBT test which are listed in your offer.

For more information and to book a test, please go online: [TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition](https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/?WT.ac=TOEFL_special_home_edition_200320&utm_source=vanity&utm_medium=vanity&utm_campaign=TOEFLatHome&utm_content=toefl-special-edition) 

### Postgraduate only 

**Pre-sessional English courses**

We have extended the deadline to apply for our Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes programme to 15 May 2020. This course will be delivered online, and has increased capacity. ** ** For further information, please see the Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes section on this page.

If you apply for our Pre-sessional English programme but are not successful in gaining a place, we will also accept students with other BALEAP accredited pre-sessional courses from UK universities for 2020 entry. We will confirm this against our application records.

A full list of accredited universities is provided on the BALEAP website: [Accredited universities](https://www.baleap.org/about-baleap/accredited-institutions). Please note that we cannot provide any information or advice about pre-sessional English courses run by other universities.

### Students from mainland China and Iran

**Duolingo Test of English**

Given the exceptional circumstances associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, we have agreed that we will consider acceptance of the Duolingo English Test (DET) as a demonstration of English language competency in specific circumstances.

We will accept DET for entry to our pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes programme from students from mainland China or Iran. 

For information about the Pre-sessional programme, and DET entry requirements, please see our website: 

[Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes](https://www.ed.ac.uk/english-language-teaching/ele-courses/summer-eap-courses)

We will only consider acceptance of DET for a degree programme when no [accepted English language test](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/international/english) is available to the applicant and/or when the applicant does not hold an unconditional offer for a BALEAP-accredited UK pre-sessional English language programme. 

Currently, this is likely to apply only to applicants from mainland China and Iran. 

DET will not be considered for applicants who already have a place on the University of Edinburgh Pre-sessional programme.

For more information on DET, and for entry requirements, please see our website:
