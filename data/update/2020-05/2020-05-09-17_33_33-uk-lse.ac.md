These are extraordinary circumstances, and we fully support individualsâ€™ decisions to take assessment when it feels most suitable for you, depending on your personal situation. You will not need to provide evidence to defer, and you will be able to do this online from 27 April.

Please view the [deferrals webpage](/current-students/services/assessment-and-results/exceptional-circumstances/deferral "Extensions, Deferrals and Exceptional Circumstances") for full guidance and to read the policy.
