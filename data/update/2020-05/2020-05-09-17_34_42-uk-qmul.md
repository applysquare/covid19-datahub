If you're studying a PGT award, the standard regulations for award will apply, except that:

  1. failed modules can be condoned from zero rather than 40.0 (where condoned failure is permitted), and
  2. the mark on which your award is classified will be calculated excluding the weakest 30 credits-worth of marks (or for PgCert, 15 credits).



For part-time PGT students not due to graduate in 2020 but impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the principles described will be applied in your year of graduation. The external requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) may mean that certain programmes are obliged to follow the original rules to qualify for accreditation.

The requirement to achieve a minimum overall weighted pass mark (‘College Mark’) to be eligible for award has not changed.
