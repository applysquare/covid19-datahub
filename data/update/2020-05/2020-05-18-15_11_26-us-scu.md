The following message was emailed to the campus community on May 8, 2020.

Dear Santa Clara University Community,

As we continue to shelter in place and honor the mothers in our lives on Sunday, we hope you are able to enjoy some time in nature with your loved ones. A few updates this week:

**“Celebrating the Class of 2020” Update  **   
One of the most painful consequences of this pandemic is that our in-person graduation cannot take place on campus next month. Whether for their undergraduate or graduate degree, the graduation ceremony is one of the true milestones in our students’ lives. While not a replacement for the commencement ceremonies which will be rescheduled, we will confer our degrees virtually to our undergraduates on Saturday, June 13. More details on this virtual celebration and all the other ways we are honoring the Class of 2020 will be forthcoming.  Note that the graduate programs will celebrate their graduating students via different means, including some virtual events.

A working group of students, faculty and staff continues to meet to work on plans for an in-person undergraduate commencement ceremony at a later date. Details, dates, and events for this rescheduled ceremony will be guided by public health orders in effect at the time, as well as the recommendations from the working group.  

**Ordering Commencement Attire  
** In response to requests from students and families, the Class of 2020 will be able to order caps, gowns and other commencement attire online for home delivery.  A web portal link will be sent out early next week via email to members of the Class of 2020.  Graduates should order asap to ensure delivery for their respective virtual celebration.

**Spring 2020 Move Out:** The University has worked out a plan for a staged and orderly move-out that will comply with Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) [guidance on social distancing](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.sccgov.org_sites_phd_Pages_phd.aspx&d=DwMFaQ&c=iVyFbx9TtkoGWXYs40w9MA&r=9k5n2oPyzqhG-S_A75SOaw&m=f4hJMyqBG6w4ejZQZgGS2mKiDj2CLHrj5zn6aHdMh2Q&s=nhwJYuXlG21b--W2XctbR-IpRvOUo67AQZzhYIpL4GE&e=).  We are offering students who reside within 50 miles of SCU—as verified by the permanent address of record—the opportunity to retrieve their personal belongings from campus housing between May 12 and May 25. 

Please[ review this information for details](https://www.scu.edu/living/spring-move-out/) on how to sign up for a move-out time and properly move out of your residential space. Students will be informed of their assigned time slot and move-out procedures in a follow-up email.  

Students who do not live within 50 miles of SCU will be offered a similar process to  come to campus to retrieve their personal belongings at a later date, once Santa Clara County guidance permits. We encourage students to continue to visit the[ Housing Office website](https://www.scu.edu/living/) for the most updated information. Additionally, information about packing, storage, and/or shipping options for students will be available on the Housing Office website the week of May 11. As soon as the county guidelines allow us, all students will be required to retrieve their belongings either in person or using a local proxy.

**Join us in Worship:**  One of the hallmarks of our Santa Clara community is how we come together in worship.  Beginning this Sunday, we will offer Sunday 10 a.m. (PDT) Mass on Zoom. Joining Mass will require pre-registration to receive the Zoom link. If you have already registered via Campus Ministry, your unique registration link will work through June 14. Please pre-register at: [https://bit.ly/SCUliturgy](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__bit.ly_SCUliturgy&d=DwMDaQ&c=iVyFbx9TtkoGWXYs40w9MA&r=EFuPUnFFyr7J1X9wlmp_zg&m=GeAWhDzyz5vnjFORzLBvzU6voYDaPUIl_UEK98HcXdE&s=wus7FpTwu7R3uSqp29C7sHGnqH2mVQk3uTGk_WcOKFs&e=)

Students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni and friends of the University are welcome.

**CARES Act:** As mentioned last week, the University has received funds from the recent federal stimulus package, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Funding under the Act stipulates that at least 50% of the allocation be used to assist undergraduate and graduate students with unanticipated expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. The application is available through [eCampus](http://ecampus.scu.edu/) and a dedicated [CARES Act Relief Fund FAQ page](http://www.scu.edu/covid-19/cares-act-relief-fund-faqs/) has additional information. 

**Important Information for Off-campus Students:** Given the extension of the county shelter-in-place order through May 31, we want to reiterate that a return to campus and adjacent neighborhoods is not advisable at this time. We recognize that many students will need to move out of their residence in accordance with their lease, and advise that students do not do this in May unless their lease ends this month. We thank all those students who are currently abiding by the shelter-in-place guidance from the County.

A reminder to continue to consult our [COVID-19 website](http://scu.edu/covid-19) and its regularly updated “[frequently asked questions](https://www.scu.edu/covid-19/faqs/)” section. You may also email questions to [covid19@scu.edu](mailto:covid19@scu.edu). 

Thank you as always for your generosity, patience and grace as we navigate this evolving situation together.  We continue to hold our Bronco community in our thoughts and prayers.
