UPDATED May 8, 2020: Georgia Techâ€™s grading policies will be in place as in any typical summer. Courses designated with a pass/fail option, can be taken as such if selected by the grade mode change deadline. Students should consult with their academic advisors before selecting the pass/fail option, if available for that course, to ensure that the course does not need to be taken for a letter grade to meet degree requirements.
