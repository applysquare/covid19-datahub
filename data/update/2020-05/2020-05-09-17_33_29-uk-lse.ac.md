**Undergraduate students**

  * If you defer, you will sit your assessment(s) in the In-Year Resit and Deferred Assessment Period (IRDAP). For 2020, the IRDAP will now be held from 27 July to 17 August 2020. A schedule of individual assessments will be released on 9 July.  
  
Assessments taking place in the IRDAP will be online, and they will follow the same method of assessment as they would in if you had taken them in the Summer Term 2020 period.   
  
You also have the option to defer again to the 2020/21 assessment period.
  * **Postgraduate students**  
The next suitable opportunity will be in the equivalent assessment period in 2020/21 ( if you are deferring a May/June assessment, it will be scheduled to take place in May/June 2021).   
  
It is expected that you will be assessed using the assessment format as outlined in the course guide if you defer to the 2020/21 exam and assessment period.
