The University is working to ensure students are able to continue with their studies. All teaching, assessment and academic support for the remainder of this academic year will be delivered online. Students will still be able to access academic resources as well as academic and pastoral support services online and remotely. We will therefore not be providing compensation or refunds as a matter of course.

If you are not satisfied with our arrangements, then you will be able to use our [formal complaints procedure](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/studentadmin/appeals-complaints/for-students.page) and we will assess each complaint on its own merits.
