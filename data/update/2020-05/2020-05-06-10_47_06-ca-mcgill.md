Dear members of the McGill community:

Over the past weeks, I’ve been continually impressed with how you have all adapted to the ever-shifting demands of the “new normal” of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the Winter term almost behind us, I know that many of you are thinking about what’s next. I’d like to take this opportunity to assure you that McGill is carefully planning for the Fall 2020 semester, and beyond.

There are hopeful signs that the worst of Quebec’s COVID-19 outbreak may almost be behind us and, to be certain, our ultimate goal is resuming on-campus operations as soon as it is safe and possible to do so. However, there may be temporary limitations to how we are able to use our campuses as we work toward a return to in-person activities. No matter what, rest assured that we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our community, and adhere to the guidelines from public health authorities. The University, working in close collaboration with Faculties and other units, has been developing multiple contingency plans to ensure that, regardless of what the coming months may bring, our students will receive an exceptional education during the 2020-2021 academic year. Whether programs are delivered through conventional means or, as a temporary measure, through remote instruction, we are committed to delivering the quality and integrity that are hallmarks of the “McGill experience.” In the coming weeks and months, we will engage with others, including students, instructors and other staff, to share and discuss the planning in more depth, and we will listen to feedback and work to ensure your voices are heard.

The Fall 2020 semester will begin as scheduled, but it’s too early to say what exactly the semester will look like. I can, however, say that we’re working with our committed global alumni community to plan special activities for our returning as well as incoming students. There will be much news to share with you in the weeks ahead.

McGill’s academic leadership and teaching staff are working tirelessly to develop programs and courses that will provide all our students, whether they live in Montreal or on the other side of the world, with both academic rigour and the necessary flexibility. We are committed to minimizing the amount of disruption, and to providing our students and instructors with the necessary resources to make the Fall semester a rewarding teaching and learning experience.

Sincerely,

Chris Buddle

Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs)
