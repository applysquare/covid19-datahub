Your department will aim to tell you if you need to complete additional coursework no later than noon (UK local time) on 7th April. Where possible you should try and refrain from contacting departments before then to enable them to complete the work needed. **Additional assessments will be kept to the absolute minimum and will cover the same material as any assessment that you were expecting.** In order to work out when additional assessments are needed, the teaching experiences and marks you have received so far will be mapped against each Programme Learning Outcome to ensure there are no gaps. The nature of assessment used (e.g. the amount of group work) will also be considered.

**Online support will be provided by academic staff to help with any additional assessment that is set.** Your departments will consult with the relevant professional bodies who may also dictate whether additional assessment is required.
