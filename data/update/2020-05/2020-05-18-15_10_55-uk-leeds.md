Preparing for online exams

A few weeks ago, we shared information about the new exam and assessment arrangements( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/student-education-and-exams/ ) that have been put in place due to the pandemic. From next week, many of you will be taking online exams or completing alternative exams. Online exams are new for many of you. It’s therefore important to spend some time before your actual exams to prepare for them. This newsletter aims to help you prepare for these, sharing tips and advice on what to do to help you get through them.

More detailed information and advice is available in the exams section of the student website( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10111/examinations_and_assessment/ ) – we’ll be updating the important exam information section( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/1000021/important_exam_information ) so please check it for updates.

Who to contact if you have any questions

Our coronavirus website answers questions you may have about exams and assessments( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/assessment/ ). It also has answers to questions about our no detriment policy and ‘safety net’.

Your School should have been in touch with you directly about your exams and is best placed to answer any questions you may have about your own circumstances. 
 
Timetable

Your School will provide you with your exam/assessment timetable. Please make sure you know the dates and times of your exams so you can make yourself available for them.

Online exams may be scheduled for a 48 hour period. This doesn’t mean that you are expected to spend 48 hours completing the exam – this is to allow for time zone differences and to make sure that all students have flexibility to complete the assessment whatever their circumstances.

If you are in a different time zone – make sure you know what local time your exam will take place so that you don’t miss out on any of the available time to complete it.
 
Systems and software

You know that annoying message you get to update something on your device? And the time it takes for the update to happen? Well, you don’t want something like that happening just before or during the exam, do you? Avoid this by making sure your devices and any software on them are to date before the exam.

On the day, make sure your devices are fully charged and that you have access to a charger.
 
Online learning resources

It’s also a good idea to familiarise yourself with the online learning resources( https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/online-learning-advice-for-students/ ) available and check that you can access and log in to these resources. 
 
Virtual Desktop

Some of the software you need may be available through the new Virtual Windows Desktop. Find out how to access the virtual Windows Desktop( https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0014548 ).
 
Library resources

The Library has created a new resource for online open book exams. You can read this on the library website( https://bit.ly/2zg7CtC ).
 
Mitigating circumstances

This year, we have published Amendments to the Mitigating Circumstances Guidance( https://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/documents/mit_circ_guidance_2020.pdf ) for the remainder of 2019/20 to take into consideration the current circumstances of all students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read this document before making an application. Find more information about mitigating circumstances( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10111/examinations_and_assessment/860/mitigating_circumstances ).
 
Marking, results and resits

Your final result will be announced in July and you will be able to find this through Minerva. Find out more( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10121/marking_results_and_resits ) about how your work will be marked, how you can access your results and what to expect if you need to resit any of your exams.

Cheating, plagiarism, collusion and submitting fraudulent work

It is important for you to continue to be mindful that everything you submit for assessment must be your own work, expressing your own learning. As you know, the University of Leeds takes all aspects of academic integrity very seriously and this is a key reason why the degree that you are studying for is held in such high esteem. Please make sure you are fully aware of the University Regulations regarding cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic malpractice( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10110/cheating_and_plagiarism ). Also, make sure you understand the University expectations, and seek support to ensure proper referencing. Find more information and support on the Library website( https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1401/academic_skills/46/academic_integrity_and_plagiarism ).
