 Students with specific and complex requirements are in touch with their advisers in the Disability and Wellbeing Service and are being supported on an individual basis. Many of the new online assessments have been designed to be inclusive, so the adjustments that students require for traditional exams will not be necessary. The full assessment period should give each student the opportunity to complete their tasks at a time and within a timeframe that is appropriate to their individual circumstances.  

The mechanism for applying for short term Individual Exam Adjustments also remains in place if studentsâ€™ needs change, or if they face new challenges and require different adjustments as a result in the move to online assessments. 

View the full updated guidance on the [Individual Exam Adjustment web pages](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/services/assessment-and-results/exams/individual-exam-adjustments). 

If you have a disability or long term health condition and you do not have an Inclusion Plan in place, please visit the [DWS webpages](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/student-wellbeing/inclusion-plans).
