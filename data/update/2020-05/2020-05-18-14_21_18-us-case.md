We are sharing this message with all Case Western Reserve students so you are aware of how you can support your peers as they graduate this weekend.

To Our Graduates of the Class of 2020:

Each year we look forward to our Commencement ceremonies, which are among our most treasured traditions. While we wish we all could gather together in the Veale Convocation, Recreation and Athletic Center, we are grateful that we can mark this important milestone in the lives of our accomplished graduates virtually, given the limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Sunday, May 17, we invite you, your families and your friends to join us online as we officially confer degrees to the Case Western Reserve University Class of 2020. Beginning at 9 a.m. EST on May 17, you can view the virtual commencement videos, which you will find on the commencement homepage and on university/school Facebook pages. The videos are pre-recorded, and will remain available for viewing any time after 9 a.m. EST.

The virtual convocation ceremony will include pre-recorded video messages from university leadership, reflections from convocation speaker William F. Baker and Alumni Association President Arnold Huffman, along with the presentations of the Hovorka Prize, honorary degrees, and the official conferral of degrees.

Separate videos for school diploma ceremonies will include additional congratulatory messages and personalized recognition for graduates, including sharable digital slides honoring our graduates.

Social media engagement on commencement day is encouraged. Please use the hashtag #CWRUGrad2020 and be sure to tag CWRU on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, so we can share your celebratory posts. Also be sure to check out the special digital content created for Case Western Reserve students and families to share on social media.

We hope you remain safe and healthy. Congratulations graduates. Now more than ever, we say, “Shine on, Case Western Reserve.”
