UPDATED MAY 8, 2020:  Yes. To ensure the continued health and safety of our community during the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia Tech offers remote learning through Summer 2020. The summer remote learning program enables students to earn credits over the summer even though on-campus, face-to-face classes are still not possible. We have adapted courses for remote learning in Summer 2020 based on the best practices learned from the adaptation of remote instruction during Spring 2020.
