 Because students have different circumstances as to why they may require an extension, it is better to grant extensions when they are needed rather than applying universal extension for all.  Some students may not require extra time and so it could lead to a lack of equity across the student body.  

In addition, no evidence will be required for any course deferral, whether it’s a pre-existing summative assessment or an assessment that has replaced a Summer Term exam.  

We are also revising our approach to marking, and reviewing past student performance data at the time of marking to identify and adjust for anomalies in the performance of students during the Summer Term 2020 assessment period. 

[Exceptional Circumstances](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/services/assessment-and-results/exceptional-circumstances/exceptional-circumstances) can also be submitted for specific circumstances that affect any or all of your assessments.
