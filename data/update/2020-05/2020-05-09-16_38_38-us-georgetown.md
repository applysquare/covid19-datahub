Dear Georgetown Students,

In order to address the critical needs of students in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am writing to provide updates about funding resources available to students experiencing financial hardship during this time.

Federal CARES Act Funding

With funding provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Georgetown will provide approximately $3.055 million in direct emergency grants to eligible students with the highest financial need. The amount Georgetown received is based on the number of students with high financial need and the university’s total student enrollment.

To cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, grants of $2,600 will be provided to undergraduate students, including seniors, whose expected family contribution toward educational expenses as calculated by the university was less than $15,000 during the 2019-2020 academic year. Undergraduate students who meet the financial need criteria but who are not eligible for federal CARES Act funds will receive a $2,600 grant funded by the university from institutional funds.

Eligible students will receive a separate email from the university by close of business today and do not need to take any action at this time to receive the funds. These eligible students will be given the option to receive funds electronically or via a check mailed to their permanent address as recorded in the MyAccess student portal.

A portion of the CARES Act funding will be allocated to eligible graduate students based on certain criteria. Information for eligible graduate students will be communicated to those students in the days ahead.

Additional information about CARES Act grants is available via a set of Frequently Asked Questions. Undergraduate students with questions regarding CARES Act funding can contact studentaccounts@georgetown.edu.

Georgetown COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund for Students

The university has also established a COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund for Students. The fund has received contributions from alumni, parents, friends, faculty and staff, and provides grants to students who require assistance covering emergency expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Georgetown’s COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund is intended to provide one-time, short-term relief for students who are experiencing immediate financial hardship. The maximum amount of any individual’s grant will be $1,000. The grants are not loans and are not expected to be paid back. Graduating students are eligible to apply for costs incurred while enrolled at Georgetown.

Who May Apply:

All current undergraduate and graduate students in degree programs on the Main Campus, School of Continuing Studies, School of Nursing and Health Studies, and in the Georgetown University School of Medicine who are experiencing immediate financial hardship as a result of the pandemic;

All students must be degree-seeking;

Any student who fits the above, regardless of citizenship status;

Please note, these emergency funds for students are separate from the CARES Act funding.

Eligible Grant Categories (related to the COVID-19 emergency, including but not limited to):

Computing costs for transition to virtual learning (examples might include purchase or repair costs for laptops, PCs, tablets, monitors, printers, scanners, hot spot equipment, etc.);

Emergency travel to/from Georgetown, and/or from study abroad to home;

Moving and storage costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 emergency;

Moving and storage costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 emergency; COVID-19-related testing, doctor visits, medications and hospitalizations not covered by insurance; and

Individual student’s rent/utilities/food not covered by their family/guardian, and incurred as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.

Unfortunately, funds cannot be given to meet non-student expenses or educational expenses that were already included in the student’s cost of attendance. Students can submit an application immediately and on a rolling basis through the fall 2020 semester. Application review will begin the week of May 11, 2020.

As an institution dedicated to cura personalis, care of the whole person, we are committed to supporting our community through this crisis. I am thankful to our alumni and friends who are helping to provide this support to students who are facing hardships during this time. Students, please know we are thinking of you and are here for you.

Sincerely,

Todd A. Olson, Ph.D.

Vice President for Student Affairs
