UPDATED May 8, 2020: Remote delivery of courses entails live lectures via video conference or pre-recorded lectures that are posted for students to view in their own time. Faculty can choose to deliver their courses synchronously, which requires all students in the course to attend lectures at the same time, or asynchronously to allow students greater flexibility. Faculty who decide to deliver their instructional content synchronously follow a specific class schedule. Students taking asynchronous courses can view their lectures and work on course content in their own time provided they meet deadlines set by faculty.
