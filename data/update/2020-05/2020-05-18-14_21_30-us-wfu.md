Dear Members of the Class of 2020, parents and families,

There are just a few more days before we celebrate the conferring of your Wake Forest degrees! We’re excited and hope you are looking forward to it too.

Just a few reminders as we get closer.

Tune in to go.wfu.edu/wfugrad20 on Monday, May 18 at 7 p.m. EST to participate in the conferring of degrees ceremony.

Share in the fun throughout the ceremony by using the hashtag #WFU20. We’ll be posting live during the event so you can see how your classmates are celebrating too.

Make sure you keep an eye on the screen until the very end. We promise you won’t want to miss a thing!

And check out some special messages for you sent from members of the Wake Forest community.

As we’re putting the finishing touches on the ceremony, we hope your preparation is going well too. Have you invited all of your family and friends? Have you gotten out your festive Old Gold and Black attire? Are you preparing your Arnold Palmers to toast? Have you downloaded your virtual backdrops and social media frames? There’s still time!

We’ll see you on Monday for the conferring of your degrees.

Sincerely,

Wake Forest University Commencement Office
