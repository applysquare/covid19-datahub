COVID-19 - Assessment and academic year changes

29 April 2020 - Revised key dates for the remainder of 2019/20 and the beginning of 2020/21 - assessment, graduation and student progression.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you once again for the significant and necessary steps everyone continues to take to enable the University to move forward at this exceptionally challenging time.

To facilitate the provision of an alternative assessment regime for the remainder of the academic year, a revised timeline for assessment, graduation and student progression has been developed in consultation with academic Schools, Professional Services, Aberdeen University Students’ Association and approved by the University Committee of Teaching & Learning – a Senate committee.

This will take the University through into academic year 2020/21 in a way that acknowledges the difficult circumstances that staff and students are all facing, while still delivering a high-quality educational experience for all.

The revised dates for the remainder of 2019/20 and the beginning of 2020/21 are summarised in the table below and are being circulated to students shortly.

Thank you to the colleagues, students, and AUSA who provided extremely helpful feedback that enabled these dates to be developed.

Some updated FAQs on this matter can be viewed here.

Please send any questions or queries not answered in the FAQs to academicservices@abdn.ac.uk.
