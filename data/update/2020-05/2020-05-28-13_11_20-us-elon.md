 **Elon is planning to conduct fall semester classes on campus.** Plans for fall semester study abroad and Study USA courses are also proceeding. Fall semester academic program plans and schedules are subject to change, depending on the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Elon’s plans are being developed by a [**Task Force on Fall Semester 2020**](https://www.elon.edu/u/task-force-fall-2020/), which will recommend a comprehensive operational plan aligned with health officials’ guidance for phased re-opening of our nation.

Elon has developed a process for students who left campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic to request to receive **prorated credits for unused housing and meal plan costs for spring semester**. That process is detailed [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/housing-meal-plan-credit/).
