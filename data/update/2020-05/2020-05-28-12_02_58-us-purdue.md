The Purdue Board of Trustees on May 7 approved a resolution authorizing the university’s leadership to take action on a number of fall planning initiatives, including the implementation of an alternative academic calendar for the fall 2020 semester.

The alternative calendar would allow on-campus classroom instruction to start in August and finish by Thanksgiving break; the balance of the semester would be completed thereafter by remote means and methods. The adjustment of customary University holidays and fall breaks, including Labor Day and October break, would be necessary to accomplish this schedule. Below is the approved alternative academic schedule for Fall 2020.

Alternative Calendar

Aug. 17 – Academic Year Faculty/Staff First Day

Aug. 24 – Classes Begin

Nov. 24 – Face-to-Face Instruction Ends

Nov. 25-28 – Thanksgiving Break (no classes – 25, 26, 27; University Holidays – 26, 27)

Dec. 5 – Classes End

Dec. 7-12 – Final Exams

Dec. 13 – Commencement

Dec. 15 – Grades Due

Dec. 22 – Academic Year Faculty/Staff Last Day

Alternative calendar – IMPORTANT POINTS for academic year faculty/staff:

There is no change in the start date and end date to the faculty contracts.

There is no change to individual’s pay.

Academic year faculty, staff and graduate assistants will be paid their full academic semester (i.e. through and including December 22, 2020). All days following when grades are due (December 15th) will be considered paid leave to make up for lost holidays and paid breaks due to the compressed calendar.
