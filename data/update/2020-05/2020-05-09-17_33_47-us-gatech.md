UPDATED May 5, 2020: This will depend on the student and the source of the money. In some cases, if they move to Spring/summer (since itâ€™s the same aid year) we could basically apply that same money, again assuming their financial circumstances have not changed. Some may actually want to re-apply for assessment.

If the student opts to defer to the following fall, it will be a new aid year and they will need to resubmit documents for aid packaging.
