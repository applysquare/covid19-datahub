All UWâ€“Madison sponsored travel is now cancelled through June 30. The measure was extended to the end of June to help keep employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Domestic travel starting after July 1 may be booked now (or remain booked), if prudent. However, domestic travel plans July 1 and beyond may need to be canceled either due to additional public health or campus travel guidance or financial exigency. At this time, we advise not making reservations for international travel until after June 30.

In limited cases, academic deans or vice chancellors may approve travel during this travel ban. Employees seeking an exception to the travel order will need to download and complete the Essential Travel Exemption Form. Following division leadership approval, these forms should be submitted to Dan Langer at dan.langer@wisc.edu.

Please cancel all travel during this period that has not been submitted for an exemption. This should be done either through Concur or by calling Fox World Travel 866-230-8787 by the end of business day on Thursday, April 30, 2020. For a list of flights by division that have not yet been cancelled, please visit: https://www.wisconsin.edu/travel/2020/03/27/uw-madison-flight-cancellation/ or contact Rusty Haines, UW Travel Manager, at rusty.haines@wisc.edu for assistance.

People who travel regularly as part of their jobs, such as Extension employees, should check with their deans or other unit directors for further guidance.
