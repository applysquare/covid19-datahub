With a targeted goal of a safe return to in-person classes for the fall 2020 semester, Clemson officials announced an extension of the University’s current modified operational status through May 31. The University previously announced the suspension of all statewide events through the end of May, and all summer instruction will be conducted online. All faculty and staff should continue to work remotely unless previously approved for on-campus access.

University leadership, in conjunction with the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), is developing a phased plan which allows for the resumption of on-campus operations as soon as circumstances allow, with the health of students, faculty, staff and the community as its overarching priority.

More details about the phased approach, with specific guidance for faculty and staff including safety guidelines and protocols and the use and availability of community protective equipment (face coverings, PPE), will be provided soon.

Employees currently authorized to work on campus are expected to follow CDC recommendations relating to face coverings and other ways to protect yourself and others, to slow the spread of COVID-19 and assist the University to reach its goal of a safe return to in-person classes for Fall 2020.
