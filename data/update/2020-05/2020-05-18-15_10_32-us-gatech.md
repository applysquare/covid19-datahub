UPDATED May 8, 2020: Most summer courses in OSCAR have been tagged with attributes “SYNC” or “ASYN” to denote how the course will be delivered. Students may reference their individual schedule and get up-to-date information on their courses directly in the OSCAR [Schedule of Classes](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched). The “SYNC” and “ASYN” attributes are listed in the course details for each section. Updates are being made on a regular basis as final decisions are made by instructors.
