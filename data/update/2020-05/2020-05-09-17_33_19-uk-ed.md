  * Examination Boards have a great deal of experience in taking account of a range of extenuating circumstances. They will be operating on a ‘help not hinder’ basis in determining course marks for Semester 2 and full-year courses. Information about how the special circumstances process will take account of Covid-19 is provided under “Learning Adjustments and Special Circumstances”.


  * Your official course results, progression decision or degree classification and award will be published on your students record, accessible through [MyEd](https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/). The dates can be found in the FAQ above. July
