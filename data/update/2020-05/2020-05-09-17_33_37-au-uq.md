I hope this email finds you well and you are coping with the impact of the ongoing restrictions in your country. Our [Student Services](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25199) team are available if you need advice, support or someone to talk to.

While the number of new cases continues to fall in Queensland, the Government measures and restrictions around social distancing, gatherings and travel (including international borders) are still in place. As the timeline to lift restrictions is unclear, UQ has made a number of decisions in relation to Semester Two to enable you to plan for your academic studies for the remainder of this year.

The impacts of COVID-19 has meant that we have had to delay the commencement of **Semester Two 2020** with scheduled classes starting one week later on **3 August and finishing on 30 October 2020**. The 2020 Academic Calendar can be found [here](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&2=25191). The following is a summary of the Semester Two 2020 adjustments:

  * Orientation for students will be online Wednesday 29 July - Saturday 1 August.
  * Teaching will be delivered online for Semester Two, regardless of your location, to mitigate against restrictions being relaxed and then tightened again as we have seen in other countries.
  * [Census Date](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25201) and [Withdrawal without Financial Penalty](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25202) for Semester Two will be 31 August 2020.
  * [Withdrawal without Academic Penalty](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25203) for Semester Two will be 30 October 2020.
  * You can view the Semester Two course offerings [online](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25204) from Monday 11 May. If you are concerned about your courses or program of study, please get in touch with your Course Coordinator or Student Services.
  * If you are expecting to graduate this year, your award will be conferred in the normal timeframe and will be posted to your home address. We hope to proceed with Graduation ceremonies in early 2021.
  * If you have practicums and placements as part of your Semester Two study, your School or Faculty will be in touch with further information as it becomes available.



We are committed to assisting our students as far as possible to remain on track with studies. Over the next few months, we will be updating course options for [Summer Semester](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25205), should any student wish to continue to study from November 2020 until the start of Semester One 2021.

We know you will have lots of questions about your studies in Semester Two. We encourage you to review our [FAQ page](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25206). If you cannot find the answer, our [Student Services](https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~woxDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKtMuspXy77Mv~9~z7~Pv80&2=25207) team are available to assist.

Best wishes for the remainder of Semester One.
