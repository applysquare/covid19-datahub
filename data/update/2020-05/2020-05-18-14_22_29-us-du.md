Dear DU Community,

As we prepare our buildings and grounds for our phase two employees to safely and slowly return to work, we also are looking ahead to summer on campus. While a few events may be held as planned—in compliance with state and local orders for gathering sizes—we know that anything considered large or even medium-scale will not take place. This message focuses specifically on decisions about summer events, conferences and camps. A message providing more details about our summer quarter academic programs will be shared with you soon, as will our decision about Summer Commencement, typically held in August.

Below is a brief summary of the decisions that have been reached so far. This information will allow people to make alternate plans, while also helping to keep our community safe.

Admission events— Campus visits will depend on current travel restrictions, gathering sizes, and room availability on campus. We hope to have more guidance on admissions tours very soon.

The Sturm College of Law's Commencement (originally scheduled for May 16) had already been postponed. Other events across campus—Through May 27, the size of any gathering is limited to no more than 10 people. As summer progresses, we will follow local orders for group sizes, physical distancing and all other safety protocols. These rules will apply to all visitors for any purpose.

We will continue to closely monitor Denver and Colorado’s orders regarding large scale events, physical distancing and other health and safety protocols throughout the spring and summer months and beyond, and we will share updates as we have them. We’ll also continue to keep our COVID-19 website up to date with critical health-and-safety information and return-to-work protocols.

You’ll also find more information about how Colorado’s Safer-at-Home Order applies to higher education here.

We so look forward to the day when we can celebrate together, greet prospective students and their families, engage in conferences with colleagues from across the country and the world, and watch our youngest visitors enjoy our robust camp offerings. In the meantime, stay safe, be well and do good.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Haefner

Chancellor
