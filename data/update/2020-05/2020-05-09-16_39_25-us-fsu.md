This message to all students, faculty and staff has been approved by Dr. Sally McRorie, Provost and Executive Vice President for Student Affairs.

Students enrolling in Summer 2020 classes should be aware of the University Academic Calendar and deadlines that may be found in the Summer Registration Guide. There are no plans to expand or extend the options for selecting S/U grades in Summer 2020 beyond those already allowed under the normal academic policy. Students who may be considering the possibility of taking a letter-graded class on an S/U basis should review the regular rules, limitations, and deadlines that will apply this summer. The relevant policy may be found in the Undergraduate or Graduate Bulletins in the Academic Regulations and Procedures chapter.
