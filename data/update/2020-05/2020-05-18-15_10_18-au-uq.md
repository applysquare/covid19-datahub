Course Coordinators are reviewing all assessment. For courses that are delivered fully online there will be no requirement to attend campus for assessment in Semester 1. Please check your course Blackboard site for details. Your Electronic Course Profile (ECP) will be revised and your Course Coordinator will let you know when this is available. If you are unsure and have concerns about an upcoming exam or deadline please contact your Course Coordinator.
