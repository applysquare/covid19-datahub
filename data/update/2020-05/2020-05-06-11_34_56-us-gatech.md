UPDATED April 16, 2020: At their meeting April 14, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia eliminated all mandatory fees at every institution for Summer 2020, excluding the technology fee and the special institutional fee. The Board also eliminated all other fees — such as lab fees, course fees, and program fees — at every institution for Summer 2020.
