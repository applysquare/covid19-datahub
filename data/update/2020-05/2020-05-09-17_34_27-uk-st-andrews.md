No. In line with normal University policy, students cannot request their dissertation module to be S-coded. While postgraduate taught students will be able to request S-coding of their taught modules in Semester 2 of this academic year, we are confident that, through the planning and the adjustments that your School and your supervisor may have made to your final module, you will have the chance to complete your dissertation and to bring your full academic potential to bear in this process.

Where students face extenuating circumstances that are exacerbated by Covid-19, we will address these by other measures on an individual basis to ensure that no student will miss out on a degree outcome that they would have achieved under normal circumstances.
