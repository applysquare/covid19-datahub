Content is available online in an easy-to-access format via your course Blackboard site. Over 1,300 of our courses are available to access online and assessments have been altered so that there is no requirement to attend the campus to participate in examinations. Your course coordinator will be updating your [Electronic Course Profile](https://www.courses.uq.edu.au/) (ECP) soon, please have a look at your ECP for more information.

As you are currently enrolled in an internal course at UQ, there will be no change to your course codes at all. You can access your learning, support and online community activities through myUQ.

There is more information on getting prepared to study [online](https://life.uq.edu.au/online-life) here. If you have trouble accessing your username and password to log into UQ systems, please contact [IT services](https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/information-technology/student-it-support).
