The Undergraduate Degree Examination Boards, which confirm awards, will be held on 24 July, and the Postgraduate Boards (for students who were expecting to complete in July) on 4 August. Students will be formally notified of outcomes a few days later. A small number of programmes, notably the MBBS and BDS clinical programmes, will have earlier degree board dates (as usual).
