In response to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order requiring everyone in New York State to wear a mask or face covering when out in public, the University has issued new guidance and resources for employees and students who work or reside on the University’s non-Medical Center campuses.

Effective immediately and until further notice, all students and employees currently working or living on River Campus, the Eastman School of Music campus, South Campus and other non-Medical Center locations are required to wear a face mask when out in public or when social distancing is not possible, including times of brief interaction between co-workers or friends. Employees working alone in their offices and students who are alone in a room do not need to wear masks, but anytime someone is on campus and within 6 feet of another person, the mask needs to be on.

Either a cloth or surgical mask can be worn. The use of a face covering can potentially slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.

There are an estimated 1,000 employees—including student employees—currently on the University’s non-Medical Center campuses and some of these individuals have already been wearing masks for several weeks, either as required by the nature of their work or through personal preference in effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a major health care provider, the Medical Center adheres to its own face mask requirements.

Both employees currently working on campus and students living in the residence halls, as well as students living off-campus, can receive free face masks as needed.

Staff: Obtaining a face mask for work

University department heads and managers are now equipped to distribute masks to their employees, including student employees, and employees should obtain them through their manager. If managers need to order masks for their employees, they should contact Auxiliary Operations at cschauf@services.rochester.edu.

Students: Summer schedule for obtaining a mask

The provision of masks to on-campus and off-campus students will be handled through the following locations; students will need to show their ID to receive their masks and are asked to practice social distancing when approaching one of the distribution sites:

Wearing a mask or face covering is required when going out into public for essential tasks. The student mask distribution schedule for the rest of the summer is at the Wilson Commons Porch (rain location Hirst Lounge) on the following dates:

Summer Session A: May 18 to 21, from 4 to 6 p.m.

Summer Session B: June 29 to July 2 from 4 to 6 p.m.

Ten masks will be distributed per student during these times. After this, students can request masks by calling or texting the Campus Center Building Manager at (585) 329-9093 for River Campus, or by emailing reslife@esm.rochester.edu for the Eastman School of Music.

Please reuse each mask for up to a week as long as they are clean and dry.
