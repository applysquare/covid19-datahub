Dear Student Colleagues,

With the end of the semester nearly upon us, I would like to send my wishes to you for the successful completion of your coursework and projects. I know this can be a stressful time under normal conditions, but the COVID-19 concerns have made it even more stressful. Hang in there and finish strong. Good luck on finals—you’ve got this!

And, as you complete your end-of-the-semester obligations, please be mindful of any Stay at Home orders and requirements for social distancing for your state. If you live in the state of Illinois, the current Stay at Home order and the requirement for social distancing as mandated by Governor JB Pritzker can be found at <https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/>. The order states, "Any gathering of more than ten people is prohibited."

As the weather begins to warm, I know it will be tempting to get outside and socialize. Your health and safety, and that of our entire community, is a top priority of the university. We want to make sure you can stay connected during this time, so please use your university Zoom account ([https://illinois.zoom.us](https://illinois.zoom.us/)) to schedule time to gather virtually with your your friends and family throughout the summer. Please do your part to stop the spread of COVID-19 by practicing social distancing and adhering to all of the [safety precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) set forth by the CDC during this pandemic.

I wish you good health and a wonderful summer!

Dr. Danita M. B. Young  
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
