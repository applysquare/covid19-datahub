Dear Clemson Family:

Today marks the final day of classes for the spring semester, and the end of our fifth week of online instruction. All that stands between us and the end of the semester are final exams next week, and I want to congratulate all our students for their resiliency – and our faculty and staff for their tireless work to make the rapid transition to online instruction possible.

In particular, I want to once again thank our faculty for their extraordinary work. As we shared with our Board of Trustees yesterday, our faculty are going to great lengths to make sure students are getting the best possible education, and I am grateful for their dedication.

As we wrap up this unprecedented academic year, we realize that much work remains to be done as we strive for a return to on-campus instruction. Our learning model for the fall will be determined by the data and science related to the pandemic, but as our Associate Vice President for Public Safety Greg Mullen told our Board yesterday, we have “laser focus” on returning to campus as scheduled.

Our leadership team and Emergency Operations Center personnel are crafting recommendations for the University’s re-emergence from the pandemic and I hope to have more details about our plans to share soon. Rest assured, however, that any and all decisions will be made with the safety of our students, employees and communities in mind.

As we look toward a new academic year, we already have taken strong steps in support of our students and their families. I am pleased to share the news that yesterday our Board of Trustees unanimously accepted University leadership’s recommendation to freeze tuition and mandatory academic fees for both in-state and out-of-state undergraduate students for next year. A decision on housing and dining fees will be made in the near future.

Although the pandemic has had a significant financial impact on the University, holding the line on tuition is simply the right thing to do given the economic challenges facing many of our students and their families. I want to thank our Board of Trustees for its continued guidance and leadership on behalf of our students, whose success is always top of mind.

To help the University weather the continued financial impacts of the pandemic, our Board also approved a preliminary budget for fiscal year 2020-21, which begins July 1, that caps our spending at current levels. The University already has instituted a hiring freeze through at least the end of the fiscal year and we have reduced spending in numerous other areas. We will continue to closely monitor our expenses as we work to deliver a high-quality education during this challenging period.

In closing, I would like to share a couple examples that highlight the true spirit of the Clemson Family. As I previously shared, our region was hit with severe storms early last week, including a large tornado that devastated parts of neighboring Seneca. As you would expect, our employees have stepped up in a big way to help their friends and neighbors.

In addition to ongoing support from Clemson University Fire Department, emergency and facilities personnel who have assisted with clean-up and rescue efforts, more than 60 University employees volunteered over the past week at a comprehensive community support operation that has been established in Seneca. My thanks go out to all those who have given their time and energy to help our neighbors in need.

Finally, this is our annual Week of Gratitude where our Development and Alumni Relations team makes time to thank all those who have given to the University. Due to the pandemic, we have created a virtual celebration, but our gratitude remains very real.

Let me add my thanks to everyone out there who has supported Clemson – we couldn’t serve our great students without your support. And speaking of great students, I invite you to watch this video of some of our students saying “thanks” to our donors.

Again, my sincere appreciation goes out to the entire Clemson Family for making this such a special place. Good luck to our students on finals – and stay safe!

Go Tigers!

Jim Clements

President
