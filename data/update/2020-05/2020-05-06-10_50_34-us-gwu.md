Dear GW Students,



As you continue to adjust to learning and engaging remotely, we appreciate the flexibility you have demonstrated and the creative ways that you are adapting to our virtual classrooms. We are committed to supporting your progress and well-being. For some of you, this may mean graduating and finding employment, and while this may be especially challenging in our current environment, I encourage you to take advantage of the resources offered by our career service offices. For others who are continuing through summer or planning for fall, we are making every effort to ensure your continued progress. As you are now aware, we have made adjustments to academic policies, including the option for most undergraduate courses to be taken as pass/no pass, and we have relaxed financial and advising holds. We will continue to evaluate and share with you other initiatives we are pursuing to alleviate the added burden of this disruption. Most importantly, as you wrap up this semester, there are additional resources below that I encourage you to use.

We are committed to supporting you as we work through this transition together. We look forward to joining many of you and your families at the virtual Commencement celebration on May 17th.



Sincerely,



M. Brian Blake

Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
