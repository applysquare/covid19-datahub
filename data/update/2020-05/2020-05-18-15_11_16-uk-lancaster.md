We recognise that most students will have experienced disruption to teaching, coursework and examinations and we are monitoring the advice and guidance from a number of awarding bodies. As the extent of the disruption becomes clearer, we will be in a better position to update you on other related policies.

We will aim to be flexible if you narrowly miss your offer grades.
