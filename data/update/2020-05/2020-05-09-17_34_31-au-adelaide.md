We have not formally recalled students as concerns remain about the safety of air travel and transiting. However, you should be aware that the Australian Government has now elevated its travel advice for all countries to ‘Do Not Travel’ and recommends that Australians overseas who wish to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible by commercial means.  See [here  __](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/coronavirus-covid-19) for more information.

Unless you believe you are better served by remaining in your current location, we strongly recommend you return to Australia as soon as possible.

We know that some students that are overseas are not Australian citizens. Students should consider the advice contained within the rest of these FAQs that is relevant to you and also information specific to your citizenship and status in Australia. If you are an international student currently overseas, you may want to consult with [International Student Support](https://international.adelaide.edu.au/life-on-campus/support-services) for advice.

If you are returning to Australia please ensure you contact AIG Travel Guard in the first instance.

The University’s policy number is 2300110171. 

Please note that all travellers arriving in Australia must undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated facilities (for example, a hotel), in their port of arrival.
