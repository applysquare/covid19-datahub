### Latest information

**Updated Monday 4 May  ** **2020, 1pm  
**

  * The University has published guidance surrounding the **[Safety Net Policy for students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/assessment/safetynet)** , which covers all exams and assessments from 15 March 2020. 
  * Government advice states that people **must stay at home** and should only leave for one of four reasons: shopping for basic necessities, including food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible; one form of exercise a day - alone or with members of your household; any medical need or to provide care for a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from essential work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home. **It is absolutely imperative that staff and students adhere to this.**
  * **Student travel home within the UK is no longer classed as essential**. Students should remain where they are currently living and follow social distancing rules - see [advice for current students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students) for more information.
  * Staff carrying out **business critical work** that requires them to be on campus - where there is a significant consequence to health, safety and welfare if the work cannot continue - should have been notified and must carry a valid photo ID/UCard with them at all times.
  * Stay at home for seven days if you have a high temperature and/or a new continuous cough. Anyone sharing your household will need to also stay at home for 14 days from when you first developed symptoms.
  * The best defence to prevent the spread of coronavirus continues to be **good hand hygiene practices** and **social distancing**.
