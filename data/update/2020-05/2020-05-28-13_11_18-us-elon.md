Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

This is the final weekly “Monday update” email message as we begin to shift to a summer communication schedule to prepare our community for beginning the 2020-21 academic year. The [university coronavirus website](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/) will continue to be an updated source of information.

Today’s update summarizes the current status in North Carolina and at the university, provides information about degree conferral this week, and provides information about move-out for on-campus residents, summer information, and plans for informing the community about the work of the Task Force on Fall Semester 2020.

**Current status**

  * There have been [19,023 laboratory-confirmed cases](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc) of COVID-19 in the [state of North Carolina](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina), including 215 in Alamance County.  A total of 661 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.
  * There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Elon students, faculty, or staff who have been on campus during a possible period of contagion.
  * The state of North Carolina remains in [phase one](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/Phase-1-Side-by-Side.pdf) of the three-phase plan for reopening. Gatherings continue to be limited to ten people or fewer, individuals can leave their homes for commercial activity, and more businesses are open – although restaurants continue to be available for take-out and delivery only. Face coverings are encouraged when leaving your residence.
  * The university is also in phase one operations, as more staff have returned to work on-campus to prepare for re-opening facilities and offices in the coming weeks.  Currently Elon facilities remain closed to walk-in traffic, and most services will continue operating remotely or by appointment. Facilities / essential services available on campus continue to include: 
    * To-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu here)
    * Student Health Services (hours and appointment information here)
    * Faculty/Staff Health & Wellness Clinic (hours and appointment information here)
    * Moseley Center – including Mail Services and Student Professional Development Center (Monday-Friday, 10 am – 2 pm), and
    * Two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 am – midnight.



**Degree conferral and commencement activities this week**

  * Members of the Undergraduate Class of 2020 will be officially awarded their degrees during an online conferral ceremony planned for Friday, May 22, at noon EDT. The ceremony will be streamed at [www.elon.edu/live](http://www.elon.edu/live). Members of the Class of 2020 and their friends and family are encouraged to use the hashtag #ElonGrad this week and during the ceremony on Friday to share pictures of themselves or their Elon memories on social media. A selection of these posts will be featured on the [#ElonGrad social dashboard](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/social-dashboard/). For more information about how to celebrate the undergraduate Class of 2020 this week, see [this story](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/05/18/elongrad-celebrating-the-class-of-2020-this-week) from Today at Elon.
  * Several graduate degrees will also be awarded this week, with ceremonies streamed at [www.elon.edu/live](http://www.elon.edu/live): 
    * Master of Higher Education Commencement Ceremony, Wednesday, May 20, 3 p.m. EDT
    * Master of Arts in Interactive Media Degree Conferral Ceremony, Wednesday, May 20, 7 p.m. EDT

  * For more information about these online conferral ceremonies, visit the Commencement website, [www.elon.edu/commencement](http://www.elon.edu/commencement). Plans for in-person undergraduate Commencement exercises are not expected to be announced until later this summer, when more information about hosting events in the state will become available.



**Reminders for on-campus residents**

  * The deadline to request a credit for unused spring housing or meal plans is this Wednesday, May 20. Information is available [online here](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/housing-meal-plan-credit/).
  * The deadline to move out of on-campus housing assignments is Sunday, May 31.  Information related to moving out of on-campus residences can be found on the Residence Life website [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/residence-life/moveout2020/).
  * As students return to campus to pick up belongings in the coming weeks, we urge everyone to follow appropriate public health guidance offered in previous communications.
  * In the coming weeks we continue to discourage students from traveling to campus, unless they need to do so to retrieve belongings. Students who do return to campus should [practice physical distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) and should not plan to reunite with friends, host gatherings or remain on campus longer than necessary – at most one night. Local authorities are enforcing the governor’s executive order that limits the size of gatherings and are charging those who violate the law.



**Summer at Elon**

  * In the coming weeks, we will communicate directly with faculty and staff about the continued plans for gradually re-opening facilities and offices as the state and the university move through the next two phases of the return to work.
  * Undergraduate final exams end tomorrow, Tuesday, May 19. Registration is still underway for summer online undergraduate courses, with two summer sessions taking place May 28 – June 26 and July 6 – 27. For detailed information, visit the [Elon Summer 2020 website](https://www.elon.edu/u/registrar/summer/).
  * The Elon Law spring trimester [continues through June 16](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/academics/registrar/academic-calendars/).
  * Courses also continue in May and June for the [Physician Assistant](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/health-sciences/physician-assistant/academics/academic-calendar/) and [Physical Therapy](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/health-sciences/dpt/dpt-academic-calendar/) programs in the School of Health Sciences.
  * With the end of the spring undergraduate semester, meal plans end Wednesday morning, May 20. On that date Lakeside Dining Hall will begin operating in the typical summer mode on campus, with a retail option open for lunch Monday through Friday. For more information throughout the summer, visit the Elon Dining website, [www.elondining.com](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/health-sciences/dpt/dpt-academic-calendar/).
  * Student Health Services will be open for clinical appointments (see [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/)) through Friday, May 22, after which the clinic will be closed for the summer. Information for summer and after-hours care will be available on the Student Health Services website [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/after-hours-and-summer-care/).



**Planning for fall semester**

President Book has appointed a Task Force on Fall Semester 2020, made up of faculty, staff and students, to create a comprehensive plan to resume on-campus instruction and residence life this fall. The task force began its work immediately and formed three working groups involving many consultants from the campus community. **The task force will make recommendations later this month, with announcements about plans for the fall semester expected by early June**. Learn more about the Task Force and follow its work at: <https://www.elon.edu/u/task-force-fall-2020/>.
