With the pause in teaching earlier this semester, additional time for teaching and learning activities has been scheduled at the end of the semester. This will result in a change to examinations and postponing graduation ceremonies until later in the year. Graduating students will still have their degrees conferred after the finalisation of Semester 1. The University Calendar has been updated to reflect the new dates ([click here](https://www.uq.edu.au/events/calendar_view.php?category_id=16&year=2020&month=&day=01)).
