Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

This week’s Monday update summarizes the current status in North Carolina and at the university, describes what is happening on-campus this week as more essential employees return to work on campus, and provides information about the end of the semester and future planning.

Next Monday, May 18, will mark the final regular “Monday update” email message as we begin to shift to a summer communication schedule to prepare our community for beginning the 2020-21 academic year. The [university coronavirus website](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/) will continue to be an updated source of information.

**Current status**

  * There have been [15,045 laboratory-confirmed cases](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc) of COVID-19 in the [state of North Carolina](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina), including 178 in Alamance County.  A total of 550 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.
  * There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Elon students, faculty, or staff who have been on campus during a possible period of contagion. The university will continue to report positive cases in accordance with county, state, national and international guidelines.
  * North Carolina has entered the first phase of reopening business and Governor Cooper released a [new executive order](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO138-Phase-1.pdf) outlining the eased restrictions on travel, business operations, and mass gatherings. Gatherings continue to be limited to ten people or fewer, individuals can leave their homes for commercial activity, and more businesses are open – although restaurants continue to be available for take-out and delivery only. Face coverings are encouraged when leaving your residence. A side-by-side comparison for what’s new in the first phase is available on the governor’s website [here](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/Phase-1-Side-by-Side.pdf).



**On-campus this week**

  * Because Elon University never fully closed, essential employees have been working on campus throughout the past several weeks.  Today we began North Carolina’s Phase One operations, bringing the full contingent of essential staff back to work on campus to help prepare for re-opening facilities and offices. Staff received guidance about this gradual return to work in a May 4 message from Kelli Shuman, Assistant Vice President for Human Resources. The message, [archived on the university coronavirus website](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/guidelines-for-physical-distancing-and-hygiene/), included guidelines for physical distancing and hygiene, information for employee self-monitoring, and expectations for employees and supervisors.
  * Even as more staff return to campus to prepare for phase two, Elon facilities remain closed to walk-in traffic, and most services will continue operating remotely or by appointment. Essential services available on campus continue to include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu [here](https://www.elondining.com/menu-hours/)), Student Health Services (hours and appointment information [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/)), Faculty/Staff Health & Wellness Clinic (hours and appointment information [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/bft/wellness/)), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10 am – 2 pm), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 am – midnight.
  * This week the Student Professional Development Center, will re-open its Moseley Center location, with hours Monday-Friday, 10am-2pm in addition to the online appointments and availability. For additional information visit the [SPDC website](https://www.elon.edu/u/spdc/).
  * Undergraduate classes for the spring semester end tomorrow, May 12, with final exams starting Wednesday evening, May 13, and continuing through Tuesday, May 19. The undergraduate final exam schedule can be found in [OnTrack](https://ontrack.elon.edu/). The Elon Law spring trimester [continues through June 16](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/academics/registrar/academic-calendars/) and courses also continue in May and June for the [Physician Assistant](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/health-sciences/physician-assistant/academics/academic-calendar/) and [Physical Therapy](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/health-sciences/dpt/dpt-academic-calendar/) programs in the School of Health Sciences.
  * Registration is still underway for summer online undergraduate courses, with two summer sessions taking place May 28 – June 26 and July 6 – 27. For detailed information, visit the [Elon Summer 2020 website](https://www.elon.edu/u/registrar/summer/).
  * President Connie Book will host an online Parent Town Hall Forum at noon on Tuesday, May 12. The event will be open to the Elon community at: [www.elon.edu/live](http://www.elon.edu/live).



**Spring semester information for undergraduates**

  * Undergraduate students are reminded that the deadline to designate course grading pass/fail for the Spring 2020 semester is Wednesday, May 20. Frequently asked questions about this special pass/fail designation can be found under the [“Online Learning” tab](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/student-information/#online-learning) of the university coronavirus website. Students should consult with their academic advisor and course faculty as they consider this important decision for each of their courses.
  * Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on campus currently, it does not mean there may not be students who are asymptomatic or with very mild cases. In these instances the  infected students may not realize they are ill or putting others in danger. We continue to urge students returning to campus to pick up belongings in the coming weeks to follow appropriate health guidance, offered in previous communications.  Most notably, we continue to recommend that **students should not return to campus to reunite with friends, host gatherings, or remain on campus longer than necessary** – one night at most. Information related to moving out of on-campus residences can be found on the Residence Life website [here](https://www.elon.edu/u/residence-life/moveout2020/).
  * The due date for spring **textbooks rentals** has been extended to June 15. Please visit the Elon Bookstore website [here](https://elon.bncollege.com/shop/elon/page/rental-book-return) to generate a FREE return label to ship rentals back to the bookstore.  The form will expire after the June 15 due date. The final charge date for non-returned rental fees will be August 25. Barnes & Noble is offering remote **textbook buybac** k for students to sell back non-rented textbooks at the end of the semester. A FREE shipping label is included. The link can be located on the [bookstore website](https://elon.bncollege.com/shop/elon/home) or directly linked [here](https://onlinebuyback.mbsbooks.com/index.php?ACTION=home&CSID=A3JJAZC2AAQZCQOATQM2UAWMB&jde=10380637). Be sure to contact Carly Mayer, Bookstore Manager, with any questions at cmayer4@elon.edu.



**Planning for fall semester**

President Book has appointed a Task Force on Fall Semester 2020, made up of faculty, staff and students, to create a comprehensive plan to resume on-campus instruction and residence life this fall. The task force began its work immediately and formed three working groups involving many consultants from the campus community. The task force will make its recommendations by May 27. Learn more about the Task Force and follow its work at: <https://www.elon.edu/u/task-force-fall-2020/>.

**Sources of information**

We continue to recommend the following sources for those seeking more information about the coronavirus pandemic and the university response:

  * The coronavirus website maintained jointly by several federal agencies: <https://www.coronavirus.gov/>.
  * The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services with information about the state-level response to COVID-19: <https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19>.
