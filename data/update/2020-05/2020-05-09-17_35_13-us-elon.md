Dear Members of the Class of 2020, Families and Guests:  
Please join us virtually for a celebration of the achievements of the Class of 2020 as we officially award degrees in an online Conferral Ceremony on Friday, May 22, at noon EDT. Details can be found in the invitation link below and on the Commencement website at [www.elon.edu/commencement](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/).

While this conferring of degrees is not intended to simulate or rival our delayed in-person Commencement activities, it will provide the opportunity to officially award degrees to the Class of 2020 and recognize studentsâ€™ achievements over the past four years. Musical presentations by members of the Class of 2020 and remarks from the Senior Class Officers and President Book will be included in the 30-minute ceremony. A Certified Electronic (CE) diploma will be emailed to each graduate at the conclusion of the Conferral Ceremony. Printed diplomas and covers will be mailed later in May.

Details will be shared in the coming weeks regarding ways we can all use social media to celebrate the Conferral together. To make arrangements to have your cap and gown shipped or to submit a senior photograph to the yearbook, visit the [Commencement web site](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/commencement/).

We will keep you updated as we continue to assess when it will be safe to hold in-person Commencement and related activities. I look forward to celebrating Class of 2020 milestones with you virtually on May 22 and in person as soon as we can.  
Sincerely,

Connie Ledoux Book  
President
