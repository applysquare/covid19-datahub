Purdue has announced that operations will remain mostly unchanged through July to ensure the safety of faculty, staff and students, and to provide the University time to continue assessing actions needed to return to residential instruction for fall semester.

As of now, nearly all employees who are working remotely should continue to do so until and unless instructed otherwise by their supervisors. Those who work in research labs should continue to follow direction provided by the executive vice president for research and partnerships. Those who are in essential roles and must be on campus — as determined and communicated by supervisors and departments — should follow safe health practices.

All July events on the West Lafayette campus will be canceled, including conferences, camps, and summer programs. All summer course modules scheduled to begin in July will be conducted online. Summer College for High School Students will be conducted remotely. As was the case in May and June, limited exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for small scale experiential learning following a public health review and approval. The other exception will be Summer Start and Early Start programs, which begin July 10 and will move ahead as planned, implementing the health recommendations of the Safe Campus Task Force. Some student activities and programs will be available in July and will be communicated once details are solidified.

Campus faculty with Extension appointments and Extension educators will follow Purdue Extension event guidance, including as it relates to 4-H fairs. Athletics will continue to follow conference and NCAA guidance. Information on fall events will be shared in the coming weeks.
