UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. – In the interest of the health and safety of staff and participants, Penn State is canceling, rescheduling or moving to virtual delivery all nonessential events and meetings through at least June 30. This decision applies to all nonessential events, meetings, summer camps, youth programs and gatherings of all kinds on all Penn State campuses.

Any essential in-person meetings or events must have fewer than 10 attendees and maintain good social distancing practices with all staff and participants wearing face masks.

For essential large events expected to have more than 10 attendees, approval to hold the event must be sought from the executive vice president and provost by emailing provost@psu.edu. All requests should include a description of how social distancing will be maintained during the event.

The University’s task group focused on Athletics, Camps and Other Large Events is continuing to monitor the pandemic and will determine at a later date whether events after June 30 can be held in person. The decision will be in alignment with orders and guidance from government and public health authorities and there likely will not be a one-size-fits all approach, depending on how the situation evolves. The task group will likely consider a variety of factors for individual events, including the type of event, where the event will take place, and who is attending the event.

Some individual event organizers may determine at this point that they will be canceling, postponing or holding virtually events after June 30. Individuals with questions about events, meetings, summer camps, youth programs and other gatherings taking place after June 30 should contact the event organizer to determine the status of the event.
