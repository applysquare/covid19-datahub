Dear Undergraduate Students:

As we shared with you in our March 24 e-mail, in recognition of the unprecedented challenges due to the outbreak of COVID-19, we approved a policy to allow undergraduate students the opportunity to elect to convert any of their Spring 2020 course grades (numbered 4999 and below) to Pass/Fail at the end of the semester once their assigned grades have been submitted.

After careful consideration and collaboration between the Office of the Registrar and ITS, you will be able to make your Pass/Fail election choices in BearWeb during the time periods indicated below. Instructions for how to make your elections in BearWeb are available at www.baylor.edu/registrar/Spring2020PassFail. We also have provided the Pass/Fail Grading Policy and answers to your FAQs as helpful resources for you as you prepare to make your elections. Should you have any questions regarding this process, please contact campus resources with whom you regularly work on decisions related to registration, add/drop, repeating coursework, and/or academic forgiveness.

The window for undergraduate students to elect those courses to convert their assigned grade to a Pass/Fail basis is listed below:

Degree Candidates – Tuesday, May 12 at 5 p.m. CDT until Friday, May 15 at 5 p.m. CDT

All other undergraduate students – Wednesday, May 13 at 5 p.m. CDT until Wednesday, May 20 at 5 p.m. CDT

As we announced in March, Pass/Fail elections will be irrevocable with no opportunity for appeal.

In addition, to avoid issuing transcripts with conflicting information, a transcript hold will be placed on your account until:

your election period has ended,

you indicate that you do not plan to make any Pass/Fail elections within BearWeb, or

you have exhausted all of your election options.

Thank you for your continued patience and understanding during this unprecedented time as we worked through the details preparing this grade conversion opportunity for you. We wish you the very best during your remaining Final Exams, and please know that all of us in the Baylor Family will continue to pray for you and support your academic pursuits during the days and weeks ahead.

Sincerely,

Nancy Brickhouse, Ph.D.

Provost
