September might feel like a lifetime away, and we know you have a lot on your mind at the moment, but Student Finance England want to remind students that applications for next year should be submitted by the 19th June to make sure that your money is in place by the start of the next academic year.

Student Finance England’s website has all the information you need about applying as well as a new set of FAQ’s for current students relating to the current situation.
