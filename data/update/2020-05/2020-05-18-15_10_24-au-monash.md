Exams and assessment:

  * We recently established an Academic Safety Net working group – made up of students and staff members of the Academic Board – to make recommendations to the Academic Board about grading matters for semester one 2020, and other [teaching periods](https://click.a.e.monash.edu/?qs=f9864cc44ed499b293d8e8033cc3774d4638867784f64be1099da296ec4a5e6d42820397e1a3eb346c3724aa334dcffcafe9c44796532766) that intersect with or align with semester one.
  * Their recommendations were voted on and approved by the Academic Board: 
    * If students achieve a mark of 40-49, they can choose to complete supplementary assessment in all the units that meet these criteria. The previous cap of two units for supplementary assessments is relaxed.
    * Any existing threshold hurdles will be applied at 40, not the current mark of 45, including exams.
    * After results are released, students can choose to exclude the results of all passed units studied in semester one from the calculation of their Grade Point Average and Weighted Average Mark. This is based on the principle that the disadvantage experienced by the student is experienced in all units, not just select units. Students who opt to exclude their results will have each unit which they passed recorded as SFR (Satisfied Faculty Requirements) on the transcript.
  * COVID-19 arrangements for students enrolled in MSA teach-out courses, offered in cooperation with Monash University, will be communicated directly by [IIE MSA](https://www.iiemsa.co.za/students/covid-19-information/), the campus owner and operator.
