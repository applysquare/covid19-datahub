We currently plan to begin our 2020-21 academic year on time. For new students Welcome Week will start on the 28th September, and for the vast majority of students the academic term will begin on the 5th October (for medical students term begins on 1st September).

If government rules permit, we will reopen the campus for teaching and research in time for the start of the new term in September. This may involve social distancing measures and we are planning accordingly. If government restrictions make it impossible to open the campus immediately, then we are fully prepared to continue teaching online. We can also deliver a mixture of campus-based and online teaching if that is appropriate.
