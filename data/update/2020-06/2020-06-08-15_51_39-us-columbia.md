The Office of Undergraduate Admissions has revised its testing policy for the 2020-2021 application cycle: Due to ongoing standardized testing disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Columbia is adopting a one-year test-optional policy for first-year applicants to Columbia College or Columbia Engineering for the fall of 2021.

If students have completed testing and can submit SAT or ACT results, we encourage them to do so as we believe this information can be a valuable addition in our review process. However, testing is no longer a required component for the first-year 2020-2021 application cycle, and students who are unable or choose not to submit test scores will not be disadvantaged.
