This message to all students, faculty and staff has been approved by John Thrasher, President of Florida State University.

Dear FSU Community,

I know our students, faculty, staff, parents and visitors are eager to learn more about the university’s plan for the Fall 2020 semester, which will begin as scheduled Aug. 24.

Administrators across campus are completing a proposed plan that prioritizes the health and welfare of the entire FSU community and follows the guidelines set forth in the State University System of Florida’s blueprint for reopening campuses. We have posted a draft of the plan at fall2020.fsu.edu.

The plan outlines new policies, procedures and oversight for teaching, learning and working at FSU, and I appreciate the contributions of the many task forces and committees representing all facets of the university. It includes guidance for COVID-19 testing, face coverings, social distancing and extracurricular activities.

The plan is designed to be flexible and is expected to evolve in response to COVID-19 as circumstances warrant and conditions change in the university community, across the state and around the world.

We will present the proposed Fall 2020 plan to the FSU Board of Trustees for approval on Thursday, June 18, and then to the Florida Board of Governors on Tuesday, June 23. In the meantime, please send your feedback to fall2020@fsu.edu.

Although some aspects of university life will be different this fall, our commitment to providing a world-class education to our 42,000 students remains the same. I appreciate your patience, flexibility and resilience as we work together to provide a healthier and safer environment for all.

Sincerely,

President John Thrasher
