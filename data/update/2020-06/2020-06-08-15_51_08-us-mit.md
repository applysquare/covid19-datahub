Update on the status of summer programs and sponsored travel for students

In light of the evolving Covid-19 pandemic and the Institute’s priority keeping the community healthy and safe, the previous guidance concerning MIT summer programs and travel for students, will be extended through the end of the summer (June 29-August 31).

MIT-sponsored student domestic and international travel remains suspended;

all summer programming in which participants live in MIT residence halls will need to be virtualized, canceled, or rescheduled; and

all other summer programming will need to take place remotely.

This means that programming for the remainder of the summer should not be held on campus (buildings or grounds) and therefore must be canceled, postponed, or offered virtually. Such activities includes admissions staff travel for recruitment purposes, K-12 programs, conference services/Samberg Center, DAPER, MIT Museum, and UROPs. This guidance does not apply to research activities or any programs associated with the start of the fall semester.

In rare instances, exceptions may be made for some on-campus services. MIT faculty or staff who wish to request an exception in order to utilize campus facilities should send their request to Kate Trimble, senior associate dean, including purpose, rationale, number and affiliation of individuals, duration, and risk mitigation plan. Requests will be reviewed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor and approved exceptions forwarded to MIT’s space management group.

Students, postdocs, and recent alumni may want to consider the wide range of virtualized opportunities for the summer and/or reach out to departments and programs directly about their remote offerings.

The decision process to extend the original guidance about summer programming and travel was led by the MIT Summer Planning Team. The team reconvened on Monday, May 11 to discuss and forwarded recommendations to the 2020 Team and senior leadership.

In making their recommendations, which were endorsed by MIT’s senior management team, the summer planning team considered available public health, state, and federal guidance, decisions on summer programming by Ivy+ peer institutions, and advice from MIT Medical and MIT Emergency Management.

Looking ahead, it’s possible orientation and on-ramp programs scheduled for August could still move forward; that decision is dependent upon the larger decision that is forthcoming about MIT’s approach to campus operations in the fall.
