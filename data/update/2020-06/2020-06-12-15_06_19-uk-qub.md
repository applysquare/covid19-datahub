Many research students have a valuable skill set to contribute to efforts to deal with Covid-19. A number from across a range of disciplines have returned to clinical practice, or taken up roles with research laboratories. It has been agreed that a student wishing to undertake this work should continue to be registered as a student, and have access to latest research through Library systems. If you would prefer to take a temporary withdrawal, your School can process this through [pgr.records@qub.ac.uk](mailto:pgr.records@qub.ac.uk), and indicate the reason as Covid-19 related research.

If a student will be paid for this work (outside of the NHS, where an agreement is in place), to stop their stipend at this time, the School can email [pgawards@qub.ac.uk](mailto:pgawards@qub.ac.uk). Otherwise fee and stipend payments will continue during this time. Your funding body may not allow you to work alongside your funded research, so do contact PG Awards to discuss your specific situation.
