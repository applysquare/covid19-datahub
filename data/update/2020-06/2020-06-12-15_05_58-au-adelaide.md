Semester 2 will start as scheduled on 27 July 2020.

Following advice from the Chief Public Health Officer that it is safe for the University to resume face-to-face teaching, we look forward to welcoming most of our students back to campus in Semester 2.

We will combine face-to-face with remote learning in as many courses as possible, taking into consideration public health guidelines.

For students studying offshore in Semester 2, the University will continue to offer high-quality, remote learning.

The above applies to other study periods that begin in the second half of 2020.

We are currently working through full details for each individual course, and they will be announced in the coming weeks.
