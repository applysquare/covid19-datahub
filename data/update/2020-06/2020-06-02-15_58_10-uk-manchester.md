Your time at University is quickly coming to an end and although it unfortunately looks different to what you expected, there are some life-admin things that you either need to do or know about to make your transition out of undergraduate student life as easy as possible. There is obviously still some uncertainty over some things, but here to help is the most up to date information in our finalist check-list: ** _Your IT account_ ** A short while after you graduate, your IT account will close. This means that you will no longer have access to your documents, email, Blackboard course materials or My Manchester. However due to the circumstances this year we have extended that date until **Tuesday 31 December**. IT Services will be in touch with you closer to the time however, it may be a good idea to make copies of those emails, documents and other files that you’d like to keep to avoid a last minute rush. For more information visit the [IT Services website.](https://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/students/leaving/) On the other hand, being an alumni means you will have access to the [Your Manchester alumni portal](https://your.manchester.ac.uk). Just make sure you have updated your details in the student system. ** _Returning your Library books_ ** We recognise that there is an issue with returning library books at the moment. Unfortunately, due to government restrictions and the closure of University buildings we are unable to accept book returns until the campus begins to physically re-open. The Library has renewed library books until **25 June 2021** and will not charge any fines. If you have any concerns, Library staff are still available and happy to help. Please contact them through Library Chat or the [online enquiry service](https://manchester-uk.libanswers.com/). You can find out more information and updates on the [library website.](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/coronavirus-latest-information-for-libraries/) ** _Graduation_ ** All of our students should have now received an email from the Vice-Chancellor confirming the postponement of our July 2020 graduation ceremonies, [which you can read here](http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=48808). We are currently looking at alternative ways to mark your achievements both remotely in July and then, when time allows, in person as we recognise how important this celebration is to you and your families. **Receiving your Award certificate** We will make sure that your degree certificate will be posted to your home address. Please make sure that your address is correct and up to date on your student record. You must ensure your address and name are fully updated no later than **22nd July 2020.** To view your full name please login to your student record. Go to Student Centre and navigate to the following Self-Service > Degree Progress / Graduation > Attend Graduation Ceremony. For more information on Graduation visit [Graduation FAQs.](http://www.graduation.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus-faqs/) ** _Know how to get your transcripts_ ** An official record of the grades you have achieved (your transcript) will be available electronically in mid-August. Online transcripts can be accessed through [Digitary](https://core.digitary.net/#/user/login) for free. For more information on accessing your electronic transcript [visit our Graduation pages.](http://www.graduation.manchester.ac.uk/after-youve-graduated/copies-of-degree-certificates-and-transcripts/) ** _Update your Careers link account_ ** You’ll still have access to the **[career service](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/graduates/) **for two years after you graduate. Although the Careers Service on campus has temporarily closed, we are still here for you. You can contact the Careers Service via ** _[email](mailto:careers.info@manchester.ac.uk)_ ** to discuss how we can help or to book a **[careers guidance appointment](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/services/guidance/)** via phone, Skype or Zoom. Remember though you will need to update your details by creating an[** alumni account**](https://outlook.manchester.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=vDLR627IJPYqJP_V5nf08k99Y78IebNP4r2o98Uf_-BKsAiuOePWCA..&URL;=http%3a%2f%2fwww.careers.manchester.ac.uk%2fcareerslink%2f) to access [**CareersLink**](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/careerslink/) for job vacancies and events ** _Stay connected_ ** After graduating, you’ll be part of the largest global alumni community in the UK. Remember that the University is here to stay connected with you through exclusive events and opportunities as well as providing career support. Find out more on the [alumni page](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/connect/alumni/) on what’s available. ** _Moving out/Leaving_ **** _Manchester_ ** We know this is a difficult one to navigate this year – many of you are in a very different position so we’ve put together a [FAQs](https://studentnews.manchester.ac.uk/2020/05/12/coronavirus-frequently-asked-questions/) (as part of the Coronavirus FAQs) that should hopefully answer most of your questions about moving you and your belongings. [Accommodation FAQs](https://studentnews.manchester.ac.uk/2020/05/12/coronavirus-frequently-asked-questions/) ** _Pay all your bills and let people know you’re moving_ ** Another moving out one! If you haven’t already remember to sort out your bills as you end your tenancy. Let the utility companies know your tenancy is ending, get your final bills and make sure you pay them. Similarly make sure you know what’s registered at your student home ( bank? credit card?) and make sure you update your details. ** _Keep updated_ ** Although the official end date of the academic year would have been Friday 5 June, Student Comms and all student services we’ll still be here throughout the summer, preparing for virtual graduation celebrations, and available for support. As your student emails will still be active until the end of December, we will be continuing our communications to you over the summer with any information or important updates from the University. So remember to keep checking them to stay up to date.
