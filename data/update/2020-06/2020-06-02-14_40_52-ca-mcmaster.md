Posted on May 22, 2020 Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn

New information for the research community

As McMaster continues to implement our phased increase of research activity, planning documents, guidelines, FAQs and checklists are available on the research website, with specific information on entering Phase 1 for increased On-Campus and Fieldwork research activity.

Given the dynamic situation, please check back to the site and the FAQs often, as they’ll continue to be updated.

If you have additional questions, please send them to research@mcmaster.ca

You can find out more and register online at the research website.
