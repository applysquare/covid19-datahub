Yesterday afternoon, nearly 1,000 faculty, staff and students gathered virtually for another COVID-19 Town Hall, which focused on Marquette’s recovery plan, fall 2020 enrollment and the financial state of university.

Dr. Xavier Cole, vice president for student affairs, moderated the town hall. President Michael R. Lovell opened the event with remarks on the triple crises facing universities today: a global pandemic, unprecedented economic impacts and racism. Various members of the COVID-19 Response Team then offered updates on Marquette’s recovery planning process and responded to questions.

The event was recorded and is available via YouTube.

Additionally, the Marquette community is encouraged to visit the university’s dedicated coronavirus website to learn more about each of the response team sub-committees. Responses to questions that were not addressed during the town hall will be shared on the FAQs page.

Faculty, staff and students with additional questions should complete the online form on the COVID website or contact the appropriate COVID-19 Response Team lead, listed on the university’s coronavirus website.
