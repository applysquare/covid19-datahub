A list of courses are available [here](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/covid-19/resumption-of-face-to-face-teaching).

The specific details for each course will be outlined by the Course Coordinator in MyUni or via email. Owing to social distancing requirements, this may mean that the face-to-face component is offered in a different way to usual; i.e. timetabled at a different time or location, in smaller groups, or during a non-teaching period.
