This message was originally sent to incoming graduate students by Feridun Hamdullahpur, president and vice-chancellor.

Since my last update, we have been working on creating a plan for the fall term. Today I am sharing more details about our plans for the fall so you can plan for September with confidence.

Update on fall classes and research

You can now see details of every faculty’s course and course component offerings for the fall term online. We anticipate being able to restart on-campus research activities, including in-person research, throughout the summer, depending on the directives we get from public health. We aim to offer as much on-campus research as is possible for fall 2020.

Helping to get you Waterloo Grad Ready

You now have access to the Waterloo Grad Ready program which we’ve designed especially for you. The program will connect you to other graduate students, support you along your academic journey to Waterloo and make sure you’re keeping up to date with important deadlines. You will receive more information about Waterloo Grad Ready in your inbox in the coming days.

Housing

Your intentions to be physically present at the University of Waterloo for the fall term will no doubt evolve as the current global situation continues to change. In the meantime, you can explore your on-campus graduate student housing options. Columbia Lake Village offers a graduate student and family housing community of two- and four-bedroom townhouses, right on campus. Our residences will be fully operational. Learn more about how we’re changing to create a safe space for you.

Stay well and keep informed

I encourage you to continue to stay connected with your graduate program colleagues, and to also visit the University’s COVID-19 information website for the latest updates. Be well.
