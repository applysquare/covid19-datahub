From: The Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation

As we began Phase One of ramping up research on Friday, May 22, the Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation has worked with associate deans of research and institute directors to provide further clarity, guidance, and resources.

Phase One Reopening Guidance for research and laboratories is available.

Research guidance will continue to evolve as we progress through the various phases, according to guidelines set by the commonwealth.

Keep in mind — Virginia Tech’s success in ramping up research depends on each researcher following the safety requirements and respecting the safety of others. In order to reduce risks, there must be a strong partnership between researchers and university administration.
