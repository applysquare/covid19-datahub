Over the past two weeks, the state of New Jersey has made a number of announcements relaxing certain restrictions related to COVID-19. The University, however, continues to operate under a series of executive orders designed to minimize the number of employees working on campus and restricting many of our in-person activities in order to mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19. We anticipate that these orders will be updated by the state in the coming weeks, and we will communicate directly to those impacted in our community as we adjust any University policies accordingly. All University policies regarding remote work and our limited on-campus operations currently remain in place. 

As [previously announced](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/05/04/president-eisgruber-writes-princeton-community-about-state-university-and-planning), Princeton will decide in early July whether the undergraduate teaching program will be online or residential in the fall term. We are committed to offering the best possible undergraduate education consistent with the health and well-being of our community.

The University will continue to share COVID-19 updates through the coronavirus website, Princeton homepage and other campus communications, including the Community COVID-19 email newsletter. The [June 10 edition of the Community COVID-19 newsletter](http://emergency.princeton.edu/node/636) included the following stories:

  * A recap of the virtual conversation on race in the era of COVID-19. As COVID-19 has swept across the United States, it has unmasked and amplified existing racial inequities. The virtual panel [“Race in the COVID Era: What America’s History of Racism and Xenophobia Means for Today”](https://inclusive.princeton.edu/equity-inclusion-and-covid-19) on June 8 discussed strategies to address marginalization and empower impacted communities. You can re-watch this important conversation on the [University’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PrincetonU/videos/vb.18058830773/584802152439710/?type=2&theater).
  * Dr. Céline Gounder, a Class of 1997 graduate and an attending physician at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, will discuss her experiences serving on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic on Friday, June 12, at 11 a.m. ET on the [Princeton University Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PrincetonU/posts/10158716217210774).
  * The University’s [“We Roar” podcast](http://weroar.princeton.edu/?utm_source=covid_19_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campiagn=communications) has released new episodes featuring interviews with Department of History Chair Keith Wailoo, TIME Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal ’88, The College of New Jersey President Kate Foster *93, and Princeton philosopher Andrew Chignell.
