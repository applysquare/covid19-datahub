The University will commence teaching from 21 September as planned for most courses and we look forward to welcoming you for the start of the new term.

As we prepare for the new academic year and adapt to supporting your learning during the global coronavirus pandemic, the health and wellbeing of our students, staff and wider community remains our first priority. The University is therefore putting in place a comprehensive range of measures to make sure the campus remains a safe and welcoming place to live, work and study.

[Visit our Campus Commitment website](https://www.qub.ac.uk/our-campus-commitment/) for information on the commitments we are making to our current and prospective students. 

This includes how we will support you on your academic journey through our connected learning model and offer you a welcoming, engaging and enriching student experience with appropriate support and campus measures to protect your health and safety.
