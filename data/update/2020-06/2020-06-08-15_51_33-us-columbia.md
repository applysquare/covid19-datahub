I am delighted to officially welcome you to the Columbia University School of Professional Studies and our thriving community of students, who prioritize adaptability, curiosity, and integrity, both within the classroom and the always-evolving professional arena. The faculty, administration, alumni, and fellow students of SPS are glad you are here.

Whether you are a future innovator, or just beginning your professional journey, a seasoned manager, or pivoting to a new and emerging field of practice, an industry executive, or advancing to the C-Suite, you are about to embark on an applied learning endeavor to become a leader and change agent in your professional realm and receive the need-to-know-now skills to meet the market demands of today and tomorrow. By the end of your academic journey, you will have:

The power to address the demands of a professional world that is constantly progressing;

Both depth of knowledge in your disciplines and a broader set of skills that will help you adjust to changes in circumstance;

An agile mindset that is defined by a willingness to accept the changes associated with professional advancements.

The University is in the midst of planning for the fall semester and soon will provide definitive guidance on instruction format, based on advice provided by both public health authorities and the government. Here at SPS, we are proactively planning for several possible scenarios, including:

In-person classes on campus (including any new social distancing protocols);

A continuation of online instruction; or

A combination of in-person and online instruction for some or all of the semester.

Regardless of the instructional modality, you and other students attending class this fall will encounter a robust curriculum, receive instruction from world-class faculty, and have access to a roster of professional resources, ranging from insightful events to career enhancement services through our Career Design Lab. We will continue to keep you apprised of developments as additional information about fall becomes available. Additionally, the schoolâ€™s Division of Student Affairs is a resource you should consider leveraging.

As you prepare to join our ranks, I wanted to share the below resources and information sources to better familiarize you with SPS. These include our:

Enhanced website, including news, updates, and stories from around the school community

Presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram

SPS Features Newsletter (subscribe here)

We are committed to supporting your entry into the Columbia community and facilitating your learning process once you are here. Until then, I hope you will engage with our Columbia Summer offerings; we will plan to provide additional updates throughout the summer as we collectively prepare for the academic year.

Sincerely,

Dr. Jason Wingard

Dean and Professor
