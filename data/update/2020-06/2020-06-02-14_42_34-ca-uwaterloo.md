This message was originally sent to incoming undergraduate students by Feridun Hamdullahpur, president and vice-chancellor.

You may have had additional questions about what September will look like since we were last in touch. We wanted to take a few minutes to catch you up on all the ways we're working to ensure your first year at Waterloo is a fun and successful one, regardless of where you're studying.

Waterloo Ready is a support system to help you navigate every step to becoming a Warrior. Whether that’s meeting other students, understanding what to expect from your first year, or even tasks like how to set up your email.

We're here to guide you – all summer and through your first year as a Warrior. More details will be communicated to you in June. Check out the Waterloo Ready website in the meantime.
