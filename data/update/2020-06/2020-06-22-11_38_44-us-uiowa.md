Fall 2020 Academic Calendar

As President Harreld shared with the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, in April, the University of Iowa plans to resume face-to-face instruction this fall.

The university has decided to maintain the current academic calendar, with the fall 2020 semester beginning Aug. 24 and ending on Dec. 18. The university will closely monitor cases of COVID-19 throughout the fall semester and will take action deemed necessary to help mitigate the transmission of the virus.

On Wednesday, June 17, the university will announce its policies and recommendations for limiting exposure to COVID-19 in a campus setting, followed by a series of forums allowing community members to ask questions about the policies and recommendations.

Travel Guidelines

Effective June 15, 2020, the university will return to normal approval processes for all domestic travel. Trips for all domestic travel need to be created and approved through workflow. ProTrav will be available for the creation of domestic trips for purposes other than COVID-19 on June 12.

Please follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on travel: CDC Travel Guidance.

As always, travelers should continue to take everyday preventive actions recommended by the CDC to help prevent the spread of the virus.

International travel will continue to be restricted. The Iowa Board of Regentsâ€™ rolling 30-day university-sponsored international travel ban remains in effect, and travel to any area with high numbers of infection should be avoided. As the COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation, the board will continue to evaluate this on a daily basis and provide additional guidance if needed.

The university continues to follow and monitor the travel warnings issued by the CDC and the U.S. Department of State.
