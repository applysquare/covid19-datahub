Retrieval of Belongings

Terrier Group Move-Out Process

Between Monday, June 1, and Saturday, June 27, students who lived on campus for spring semester 2020 are permitted to return to campus to retrieve their personal belongings from their rooms, suites, and apartments. To manage this process in accordance with BU and public health guidelines, only a small group of students, called a Terrier Group, will be provided access to the residences each day. Each student has been assigned to a Terrier Group, and each Terrier Group has a variety of days and times to return to campus.

The following protocols have been established to reduce density, ensure physical distancing, and safely manage the move-out process.

Parking

Please download and print your Terrier Group Move-Out Parking Permit and display on your dashboard while on campus. University garages and lots will be open and parking will be free during the move-out schedule.

Access to Campus Residences for Move Out

If you live in a large residence (Myles Standish Hall, 33 Harry Agganis Way, for example), when you arrive at your residence please report directly to the Residence Life office in your hall to check in with staff there to confirm your assigned Terrier Group and to present your BU ID. If you live in a small hall or brownstone (South Campus, Bay State Road, for example), upon arriving on campus please report directly to your hall/area Residence Life office to check in with staff there to confirm your assigned Terrier Group and to present your BU ID.

Then, to properly check out:

Proceed to your room and remove ALL of your items.

Return your key to your hall/area Residence Life office.

If you have not already done so, update your home mailing address on the Student Link under Personal Information. If you receive your mail via USPS, update your information online here.

If you have not already done so, update your home mailing address on the Student Link under Personal Information. If you receive your mail via USPS, update your information online here. Depart campus.

PLEASE NOTE: Each student will be permitted to have one (1) additional person accompany them to their room to pack and remove items.

Moving carts will be available for your use, and packing boxes and tape will be available at no cost. Boxes and tape will be located in the lobby of your residence. Each student and guest must wear a face mask/covering while inside the residences, and practice appropriate physical distancing at all times.

Students are reminded that they have three (3) hours to complete their move out. Each Terrier Group’s time period runs 9 am to 12 noon, or 2 to 5 pm. All Terrier Groups must complete their move out by the end of their time period, either noon or 5 pm.

Movement and Density within the Residences during Move Out

Each Terrier Group is designed to limit no more than one student and their one guest in a room during the assigned date and time. In addition, steps have been taken to limit the number of people on each floor of each residence at any given time.

Some rooms may have already been packed by BU – in those cases, students will find boxes marked with their names and BU ID numbers for easy retrieval.

Students are encouraged to bring their own boxes, bags, and suitcases.

Please make every effort to maintain at least six feet of physical distancing from others while in entrances of residences, stairwells, and all corridors.

Students must remove ALL items from their room. BU will not store/ship any items remaining in rooms after the student has left campus. All remaining items will be considered abandoned and may be discarded.

Storage Options

Students may choose to store some of their items before leaving campus. BU has a strategic partnership to store items until students return in the fall. Arrangements to store items must be made directly with The UPS Store prior to coming to campus during your Terrier Group date and time. Directions on how to manage the storage options will be made available to you through the UPS vendor. Students may request curbside pickup in advance through The UPS Store. BU will cover the cost of storing your items until you return in the fall of 2020.

Finalize Your Move Out

After you have completely moved out of your room, you must notify your hall/area Residence Life office and turn in your key. Please place your keys in a key envelope; write your name, BU ID number, and campus address (building name or street address, and room number) on the outside of the envelope; and drop your keys in the key drop box at your hall/area Residence Life office. A supply of key envelopes will be available outside each Residence Life office. Students must return their room keys in order to be officially checked out of their room

Elevator Usage

Elevator usage will be limited to one student and guest at a time. Students are encouraged to use the moving carts provided by BU for this purpose. Please unload your moving cart as soon as possible and return it to the designated area.

Stairways

Students and guests will be directed to use stairs in the direction noted on signs posted in each stairwell. Please be sure to respect one-direction travel when using stairs.

Barnes & Noble at Boston University

Students may return their rented textbooks to Barnes & Noble at Boston University, 910 Commonwealth Avenue, between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm, Monday through Friday.

BU Library Books

Students are reminded to return any books on loan from the BU Library before leaving campus. There is a temporary drop box inside the GSU Link, 775 Commonwealth Avenue, near the entrance to Mugar Memorial Library. The GSU Link doors are open 8 am to 4:30 pm, Monday to Friday, via the front entrance only. Books from all BU libraries, as well as ILL materials, may be returned this way.

Mail and Packages

Before leaving campus, students are encouraged to visit their mailroom and collect any first-class mail remaining in their mailbox. Packages and other items were “returned to sender” in April.

Throughout the summer, hours of operation for the Charles River Campus residence mailrooms are 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. The Fenway Campus mailroom is open 9 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday.

Shipping

For students participating in the Terrier Group process, BU will not cover the expense to ship any items. BU will cover the storage cost until you return in the fall of 2020.

Bicycles

Students are encouraged to remove their bicycles from bike storage rooms and outdoor bike racks, and take them off campus. BU may have to remove bicycles from bike storage rooms and outdoor bike racks prior to the start of fall semester 2020. Bicycles that the University removes from storage rooms and outdoor bike racks will be considered abandoned property. Students who choose to keep their bikes on campus should make arrangements with The UPS Store to have their bikes stored in their storage facility.
