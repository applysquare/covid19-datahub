Dear Faculty and Staff,

The Ready and Resilient Oversight Committee (R&R Committee) began meeting this Monday and completed our 3rd meeting yesterday. To keep the campus community as informed as possible, we want to provide quick updates below and will work to provide updates throughout the summer via emails and the [Ready & Resilient website](https://www.elon.edu/u/ready-and-resilient/).

**Our Approach**

Per President Book’s charge, we have begun approaching the Task Force 2020 recommendations in three ways:

  1. Supporting the expertise and agency of specific departments, programs, and campus committees to complete some recommendations,
  2. Planning for and completing some recommendations which do not correlate with the work of any one department, and
  3. Pushing for decisions on some recommendations which require institutional decision-making.



**New Information**

  * **Staff holidays this fall:** Although classes will not be in session on October 7 and November 3, the university will be open both days and these are work days for staff. The normal Fall Break staff holiday will be moved to Thursday, December 31.
  * **COVID-19 supply purchases** should go through your budget manager/director/dean/VP and then will be funneled through our committee. The goal is to centralize purchases, reduce costs, and provide parity as appropriate across campus. As of this week, Physical Plant now has many new supplies in stock (wipes, masks, disinfectant, hand sanitizer, etc.) and the R&R Committee is looking at other campus-wide purchases. See Gerald Whittington’s forthcoming email on this topic.
  * **Increased time between classes:** To decrease congestion and increase time for entering and exiting classrooms/buildings, the university is adopting the recommendation to add 5-minutes between classes per the chart at the bottom of this email.
  * **Planning Week:** Schedules are still being developed for Planning Week events to occur on Wednesday, August 12, Thursday, August 13, and Monday, August 17.



**Forthcoming Information**

In the coming weeks, we expect to share updates on a range of topics, including:

  * Health screening, tracing, and quarantine plans
  * An Honor Code based commitment for our community
  * Additional COVID-19 and campus operations training for students, faculty, and staff,
  * Classroom assignments, setups, and cleaning protocols
  * The schedule for Planning Week (or days), New Student Orientation, and New Student Move-In
  * Plans for international students who must be quarantined for two weeks after entry into the country
  * Plans for Family Weekend and Homecoming which will be virtualized but will still include involvement from faculty and staff, and much more



**Our Requests of You**

  * Thank you for your good questions. We need your good ideas. Keep reaching out to us individually and through [ready2020@elon.edu](mailto:ready2020@elon.edu). We ask that you give us a bit of grace and patience as we work through the many recommendations and help prepare for this fall.
  * As your programs and departments are developing processes and making plans for fall, please share those plans through deans and vice presidents, as well as through Jeff Stein at[ jstein@elon.edu](mailto:jstein@elon.edu) or through [ready2020@elon.edu](mailto:ready2020@elon.edu) so we can ensure alignment across campus in this rapidly changing environment.



Sincerely,

The Ready & Resilient Committee
