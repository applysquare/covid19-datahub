Thinking about and planning for life after university can be daunting. With so many options it can often feel overwhelming, and you might not be sure where to start – even more so now given the current situation. Even if you had a plan in mind following graduating this summer, coronavirus may mean you’ve had to change your plan or reconsider your options.

The good news is that the Careers Service is here to help – now and for two years after you graduate. For this summer, the Careers Service have put together a schedule of workshops and events specifically for final year students, to support you in your next steps – Final Year Fortnight.

From Monday 8 June to Friday 19 June, the Careers Service will be sharing lots of content, support and resources on their Facebook and Twitter especially for finalists. The first week will focus on decision making, and will feature lots of resources to help you make decisions when you have lots of options. Added to this there are sessions to aid you in identifying your strengths and how to use them to aid the decision making process. The second week will build on the skills you’ve gained during week one, and will help you to consider your options and create a plan of action for your next 6-12 months.

Check out the full programme of events for more information on what to expect during the fortnight, as well as some online workshops you can register for today. So whether you don’t know what to do next, are feeling overwhelmed or are suffering from indecision, stay tuned for tailored support.
