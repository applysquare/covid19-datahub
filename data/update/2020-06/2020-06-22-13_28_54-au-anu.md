**The following is a statement from ANU Chancellor, the Hon Julie Bishop, on international students and The Australian National University.**  
  
"ANU has supported many thousands of students from more than 100 countries across the globe with a world-class education and a distinctive campus experience that aims to set them up for life.

"We celebrate the fact that our campus is a diverse community and that it is safe and welcoming to people of all backgrounds.

"Canberra is one of the safest cities in a country widely regarded as one of the safest in the world.

"Our students consistently tell us that their time at ANU is positively life-changing.

"We have worked hard to keep all our international students engaged with their studies during this global pandemic and the vast majority of our students affected by the pandemic have remained enrolled with ANU.

"We look forward to continuing to welcome students from all over the world to ANU, to our community, to our campus and to our capital city."
