For most students, the semester will begin with a university-wide Foundation Week which will run between 5 and 9 October, one week later than the original planned start of teaching.

If you are a returning student on a healthcare or veterinary programme, you are likely to have a slightly different schedule and your School will be in touch with you directly with the details.
