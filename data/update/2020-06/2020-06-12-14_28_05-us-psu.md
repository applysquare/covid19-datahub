UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State is making SAT/ACT score submissions optional for prospective students applying for summer or fall 2021 admission.

“We are making this change to give Penn State applicants a choice that will ease the anxiety that many future students and families are experiencing as a result of test-taking disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Vince Timbers, interim executive director of admissions.

Penn State’s application for summer/fall 2021 will be open for future undergraduate students starting Aug. 1, 2020. Students will indicate via a question on the application whether they want test scores used in the evaluation of their application for admission. Test scores will still be required for admission to certain programs. Students should check the Undergraduate Admissions website for detailed information.

The Undergraduate Admissions Office evaluates applications based primarily on high school performance as the best indicator of student success. Other factors provided through the application include student activity involvement and a personal statement. Test scores have historically been one of many factors in determining admissibility to Penn State.

Being test-optional for the coming year provides students flexibility to make this choice.

“Throughout Penn State’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked to provide students with flexibility so that they can still meet their goals of a Penn State education in a way that best serves their needs,” said Timbers. “We continue to work hard to minimize the impacts of situations that are out of students’ control.”
