June 5, 2020 – Transition to Vanderbilt Phase 2 of Return to Campus Plan begins June 8

Vanderbilt University will begin transitioning to Phase 2 of its Return to Campus Plan on Monday, June 8.

The Return to Campus Plan is tailored to Vanderbilt’s own unique density, operations and other considerations as a residential education institution. The first phase of the Return to Campus Plan began Monday, May 18, and operations that resumed were on-campus research activities that could not be conducted remotely.

The major change that will occur during this next phase of the plan includes on-campus research ramp up to no more than 50 percent capacity. Those who conduct research activities will receive follow-up information with details on Monday.

The university will continue to ramp up various operations in orderly, sequential phases and will communicate with the Vanderbilt community in advance of each phase.

The Return to Campus Plan can be viewed on the university’s COVID-19 website. >>

The following steps and precautions remain in place on the Vanderbilt campus during the university’s Phase 2:
