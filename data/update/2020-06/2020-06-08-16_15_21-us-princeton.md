To the Princeton University community,

Over the past few days, the University community has celebrated the undergraduates and graduate students of the great Class of 2020. At the same time, we have decried the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and we continue to grapple with how this country’s legacy of racism damages and destroys the lives of black people while the COVID-19 pandemic kills black and brown Americans at higher rates than other groups.

On Sunday, May 31, President Christopher L. Eisgruber shared a [message on the killing of George Floyd and the importance of confronting racism](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/01/statement-president-eisgruber-killing-george-floyd-and-importance-confronting) as part of his remarks for the [virtual Commencement ceremony](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/05/31/2020-commencement-address-president-eisgruber). You can also read the statement in full below.

**Statement from President Eisgruber on the killing of George Floyd and the importance of confronting racism**

_President Christopher L. Eisgruber released the following_[ _statement on May 31_](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/01/statement-president-eisgruber-killing-george-floyd-and-importance-confronting) _as part of his remarks to the University’s virtual Commencement ceremony. In his prepared remarks for Commencement, President Eisgruber also addressed the ongoing challenges the graduates and the University face during this global pandemic._

“In my [Commencement address](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/05/31/2020-commencement-address-president-eisgruber) for today’s virtual ceremony, I say that members of the Class of 2020 graduate into hard times, and that the world needs not only their talent, but their insight, courage, and compassion. Though I recorded that speech less than two weeks ago, intervening events have reminded us that COVID-19 is not the only tragic challenge facing our students and our world.

We have witnessed yet again how this nation’s long legacy of racism continues to damage and destroy the lives of black people. The heartless killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis occurred soon after the unjust shootings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.  It coincided with the appalling harassment of Christian Cooper in New York’s Central Park, an incident that demonstrated how easily a racist complaint could put a black man in danger. The COVID-19 pandemic itself has killed black and brown Americans at higher rates than other groups, magnifying disparities in healthcare and economic well-being.

We all have a responsibility to stand up against racism, wherever and whenever we encounter it. Commitments to diversity, inclusivity, and human rights are fundamental to the mission of Princeton University. I ask all of us to join the graduates in the Class of 2020 in their quest to form a better society, one that confronts racism honestly and strives relentlessly for equality and justice.”

**University Planning for Phased Resumption of On-Campus Research**

The University has created a [plan for the phased resumption of on-campus research](https://research.princeton.edu/research-administration/covid-19-information-researchers/covid-19-research-operations) in a safe and orderly manner, and as promptly as circumstances permit. The dates for the resumption of on-campus research have yet to be determined.

The plan asks faculty and department leadership to create procedures to resume laboratory activities while ensuring compliance with University-wide policies and public health guidance. The plan applies only to laboratory-based research on campus. Any work that can be done remotely will continue to be done remotely.

The exact timing of the resumption of on-campus research will be determined by the University’s leadership, taking into account the relevant local, state, and national public health guidance regarding stay-at-home and social distancing directives.

“Our goal is to enable the smooth restart of Princeton’s extraordinary on-campus research enterprise, with the health and safety of the campus community as our paramount concern,” said Dean for Research [Pablo Debenedetti](https://research.princeton.edu/about-us/about-dean), Class of 1950 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science and [professor of chemical and biological engineering](https://cbe.princeton.edu/people/pablo-debenedetti), and chair of the Committee on Phased Resumption of On-Campus Research, which led the development of the plan.

More information about research activities in light of COVID-19 can be found on the [Office of the Dean for Research website](https://research.princeton.edu/research-administration/covid-19-information-researchers).

**Library Will Resume Two Priority Services for University Faculty, Researchers, Graduate Students**

On May 29, [Princeton University Library (PUL) announced two priority services](https://library.princeton.edu/phased-planning-updates) in its phased resumption of on-site services — available starting on June 8 only to Princeton University faculty, researchers, postdocs and graduate students:

Princeton University Library’s Return Task Force has finalized plans for the phased resumption of on-site library services beginning with two priority services which will provide access to library materials for Princeton University faculty, researchers, postdocs and graduate students. The two priority services are book pick-up and in-house digitization and will begin the week of June 8 with Firestone Library providing the first available pick-up location in a designated area. Branches will follow during that week. 

Library locations will not be open to the public or patrons. Patrons will not be allowed beyond the designated pick-up areas. Social distancing and wearing a face covering/mask will be required for picking up books. Library staff will also be following social distancing and other protocol requirements as outlined by the CDC, State and University. Beginning June 8, book pick-up requests can be made via a link on the online catalog pages. This phased resumption of specific services is in line with current state guidance. The BorrowDirect service continues to be suspended at this time.

These steps are part of the process President Eisgruber detailed in his [ **message to the community of May 4**  ](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/05/04/president-eisgruber-writes-princeton-community-about-state-university-and-planning)regarding Princeton’s research and teaching enterprise in light of COVID-19.
