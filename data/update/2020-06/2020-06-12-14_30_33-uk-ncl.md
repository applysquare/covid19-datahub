Dear PGT and MRes students,

I hope you are well.

In this week’s update I provide you with further information on how to access and request library resources and details of our plans to provide access to some library services, when government guidelines allow. I also highlight a survey that NUSU are conducting on the move to the remote delivery of teaching which I’d be grateful if you could find some time to complete. You can find further details and a link to the survey below.

Finally, I include an important reminder of mental health support services that are available to postgraduate students and details of forthcoming NUSU events for you to look forward to.

Access to library services

We appreciate the importance of library resources and services to the furtherance of your studies. Whilst the closure of the physical libraries has inevitably restricted access to print material, we hope that you are able to maximise your use of our extensive e-resources. There are over half a million e-books and 50,000 journals already available with more being added all the time. If you would like to recommend new books or other resources in your area of interest we will do our best to acquire them for you, but for the moment, we are only sourcing electronic versions rather than print.

Our general library help service is available 24/7 and you can book one to one appointments with a Liaison Librarian for a customised online chat about your information needs. We are working with colleagues in the University’s Estates Service on plans to open up the Philip Robinson Library as the first of our buildings to provide a click and collect service for print stock. We hope to be able to do this by early July.

Considerable adjustments are needed to the building to ensure that we comply with Covid-19 safety guidelines and we ask for your patience and understanding whilst we get this right - the safety of staff and students is of paramount concern to us. We will update you on progress as soon as we can.

More information on all library resources and services can be found on the University Library webpages.

Student survey

You will have recently received an email asking you to participate in a University survey. This survey is being run by a team representing Newcastle University Students’ Union (NUSU), the University’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) team and Inclusive Newcastle. The survey will help us to understand the impact of the University’s move to remote delivery and to enhance your future online learning experience. We would very much value your participation in this survey which should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Mental health support for postgraduate students

During these unprecedented times you may find that you need extra support. If so, please make use of our Free 24/7 Post Graduate Support Service.

NUSU events

Your sabbatical officers at NUSU have asked us to let you know about the following forthcoming events:

Boom Toon is an online virtual festival brought to you by your Sabbs this weekend – 5th-7th June. There's a whole host of things to get involved in, workshops, crafts classes, speeches from keynote speakers, musicians, cooking tutorials, live performances and student artists await.

Katie Smyth, your NUSU President, is also running an extremely important campaign on everyday sexism. Tune into some podcasts from some of the University’s very own and other amazing women in leadership here and keep an eye out for more this week.

With best wishes,

Lucy
