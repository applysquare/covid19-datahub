In conjunction with the university’s efforts to restore in-class instruction and on-campus experiences for the fall 2020 semester, Virginia Tech will transition from its current status of Essential Operations – as defined under Presidential Policy Memorandum 309 – to a modified operations mode by Aug. 3.

The Transition Plan consists of three phases to complement Gov. Ralph Northam’s Forward Virginia plan to reopen the commonwealth, which is now in Phase 2. The Transition Plan provides a framework and process for scaling operations to be consistent with the governor on the easing of restrictions, and in accordance with university policy with public health guidelines in place. These guidelines are subject to change based on updated guidance from local, state, federal, or other public health directives.
