Yes. To ensure the continued health and safety of our community during the Covid-19 pandemic, Georgia Tech offers remote learning through Summer 2020. The remote learning program enables students to earn credits over the summer even though on-campus, face-to-face classes are still not possible. We have adapted courses based on the best practices learned during Spring 2020. [Please visit the Summer Session website for the latest information.](https://summer.gatech.edu/)
