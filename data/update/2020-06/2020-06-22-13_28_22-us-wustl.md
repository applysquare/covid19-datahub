**Town halls scheduled for this week**

The Danforth Campus community is invited to attend a series of town hall webinars starting this week to learn more about the university’s planning process for the fall semester, and to ask questions and share feedback with members of the Fall Planning Committee. There’s a lot of information to cover, so there are separate webinars for undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff.

**Note:**  We will be adding a fifth town hall for next week, for anyone who is unable to attend one of this week’s webinars. Check the [town hall page](https://covid19.wustl.edu/danforth-campus-town-halls-to-be-held-june-17-19/) for details.

Questions may be submitted in advance by sending an email to [announce@wustl.edu](mailto:announce@wustl.edu). (Please note in your message which town hall you will be attending.)
