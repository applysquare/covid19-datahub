Pitt will be open for the fall. The current planning effort supports all activities of the University, including teaching, housing and residence life, student activities, food services, research, athletics and more. These activities will still occur, but according to the new requirements outlined in our infection prevention and control program. As a result, we will need to modify some of our activities to ensure that they remain safe and consistent with our commitment to manage risks related to the novel coronavirus.

Academic Calendar: Following the recommendations of the University-wide task forces and public health and safety experts, the University of Pittsburgh has announced changes to its fall term calendar. These changes will bring students back to campus a few weeks earlier in August and allow in-person classes to conclude prior to Thanksgiving.

Key Dates:

Aug. 13-16: Move-in for University housing

Aug. 16-18: Welcome Week for new students

Aug. 19: Fall term begins

Sept. 4: Course add/drop period ends

Sept. 7: Labor Day, classes will take place on this date

Nov. 20: Fall term, on-campus classes end

Dec. 5: Fall term ends

At this time there are no plans to modify the start date of any of the summer sessions. As needed, flexibility will be granted to faculty in conveying final term grades, as well as to departments with respect to certification of graduation requirements. The University will deliver summer courses remotely, with the possibility of a few exceptions for clinical or field experiences that may become possible later in the summer.

Housing, Dining and Campus Facilities: In the coming weeks, we will also be announcing measures we are taking to de-densify campus, including residence halls, dining halls and classrooms, and to modify and restrict these spaces and other campus facilities. These updates will be communicated as soon as they are available, and the latest information will be posted to this website.

Flex@Pitt: Rather than choosing between in-person and remote instruction, the University is planning for a hybrid model that allows for maximum flexibility. This new model will leverage technology-enhanced classrooms that can serve both in-person attendees and remote attendees. Faculty will receive training and support on this new model and the associated technologies, and support for all members of the community will be available through the Center for Teaching and Learning and Pitt IT. Additional details about Flex@Pitt will be provided in the near term.
