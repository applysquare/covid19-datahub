For Tier 4 visa holders, in many cases you will have time on your visa to allow you to avail of the additional three months without a visa extension. However, if you find that you will need to seek an extension to your visa you can contact International Student Support ([immigration@qub.ac.uk](mailto:immigration@qub.ac.uk)) within three months of the expiry date of your visa to discuss options for this.
