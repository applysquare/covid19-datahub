Academic Year 2020/21

Earlier today we announced our plans to ensure the very best learning experience for our students for the coming academic year 2020/21. If you are an undergraduate or Taught Masters student and you are returning next year your department will be in touch with you direct.

Programmes will begin on schedule in the Autumn and we plan to reopen our campuses to students. We are looking forward to seeing you in person, if travel and visa arrangements allow. If you canâ€™t travel to campus in time for the start of term, we want to reassure you that we have made plans which make it possible to offer you a high-quality remote educational experience during the Autumn term. We will aim to further update you on our plans for next Spring and Summer terms this October, but we want you to know we will be well-prepared for any change in official government guidance.
