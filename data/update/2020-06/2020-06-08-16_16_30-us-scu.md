The following message was emailed to the campus community on May 29, 2020.

Dear Santa Clara University community, 

**Spring 2020 Move-Out Update:** Beginning today, **all** students needing to finalize their move-out from campus residence halls have the opportunity to request a move-out appointment to retrieve their belongings, from **June 3 through July 12**. Students have the option of either returning to campus, designating a proxy to remove their belongings, or contracting with[ Bronco Student Services](https://www.broncoss.com/pack-up) to pack/store/ship their belongings. Please review the Housing Office’s[ Spring 2020 Move-Out Information](https://www.scu.edu/living/spring-move-out/) for details on how to sign up for a move-out time for yourself or a proxy and to properly move out of your residential space. All persons coming to campus will be required to exercise social distancing guidelines set forth by Santa Clara County. 

**All students must make arrangements to have their belongings removed from their residence hall or neighborhood unit by July 12.**

**Off-Campus Student Information:** Students who live in non-University off-campus housing are encouraged to work with their property managers and make arrangements for a safe move-out. 

**Celebrating the Class of 2020:** An email went out earlier today to graduating seniors, the campus community, parents, and families, with further details for the June 13 virtual celebration ‘Celebrating the Class of 2020.’  The hour-long [program](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/commencement/documents/Celebrating_the_Class_of_2020-1.pdf) will start at noon PDT June 13 with pre-festivities beginning at 11:30 a.m.  Be sure to check [scu.edu/commencement](https://www.scu.edu/commencement/) for more information and details.  

**Return to Campus:** As the nation, state and county discuss opening up different sectors of the economy, SCU’s Resilience and Recovery Working Group teams are developing a “Back to Campus” guide seeking to share the myriad changes, resources, and guidance that the campus will need as we begin to slowly and safely open our campus in the coming months. The guide will include operational changes you should expect (such as requirements for face coverings and continued social distancing) as well as the factors guiding University decisions for a thoughtful and systematic return to campus.  

While we prepare, staff and faculty should plan for the current work-from-home format **to continue throughout the month of June, until at least July 6** , including all essential campus-based tasks continuing as currently approved. Starting July 6, we expect to begin a **phased return-to-campus for employees** , with designated groups of employees being given timelines for return. These factors are still being worked out: Because of the complexity of the COVID environment, the need to comply with county guidance, and the enormity of this task, it may take considerably more time after July 6 for many programs and offices to return to campus.  

**CARES Act:** A reminder that students can still apply for funds from the federal stimulus package, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Funding under the Act stipulates that at least 50% of the allocation be used to assist undergraduate and graduate students with unanticipated expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. The application is available through [eCampus](http://ecampus.scu.edu/) and a dedicated [CARES Act Relief Fund FAQ page](http://www.scu.edu/covid-19/cares-act-relief-fund-faqs/) has additional information. The FAQ has been updated with information for students who have applied already. 

**Campus Ministry May 31 Mass:** The presider for this Sunday’s virtual Pentecost Mass will be Father O’Brien. To join the 10 am (Pacific) livestream, please subscribe to the [Campus Ministry YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/scucm/featured) channel. Once you subscribe, you will receive a notification when Mass begins. 

A reminder to continue to consult our [COVID-19 website](http://scu.edu/covid-19) and its regularly updated “[frequently asked questions](https://www.scu.edu/covid-19/faqs/)” section. You may also email questions to [covid19@scu.edu](mailto:covid19@scu.edu). Stay safe and well.
