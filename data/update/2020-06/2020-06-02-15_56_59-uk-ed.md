Boards of Examiners responsible for postgraduate taught programmes have been given guidance about how to take account of the impact of Covid-19 and the industrial action when making progression decisions. The requirements for progression have been amended for students studying this year, with Boards being able to award more credit on aggregate than normal. This is where they award credit for courses which were failed or not completed based on your performance in other courses which were not affected by Covid-19 or industrial action. 

In order to be eligible to progress to the dissertation or research project on your programme, you must have achieved a mark of 50% or more in at least 60 creditsâ€™ worth of courses, with an average of 50% across all courses unaffected by Covid-19 or industrial action.
