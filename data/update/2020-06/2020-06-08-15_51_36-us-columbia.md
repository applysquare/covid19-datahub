Dear Admitted Institute of Human Nutrition MS Student,

We hope this email finds you and your loved ones well. During this COVID-19 crisis, nutrition and its contributions to health outcomes have become even more apparent as is the need for healthcare providers to be well trained in nutrition. The IHN Masters in Human Nutrition is uniquely positioned to provide fundamental understanding of the nutrition-health outcomes relationship through an excellent educational experience that meets your academic and career goals.

As we head into the summer months, the faculty and staff of the IHN are planning for the 2020-2021 academic year with your needs in mind. After careful deliberation, we are excited to share our plans with you for the upcoming academic year:

Fall Term 2020: Our fall coursework will be run online via an engaging, interactive curriculum, based on best practices in distance learning. In general, the courses will be a blend of interactive, synchronous sessions, combined with asynchronous lectures and activities. This will optimize discussions with faculty and your classmates. Spring Term 2021: We intend to return to the in-person classroom format, and in-person thesis research starting in January, 2021. Some students may opt to remain in the program remotely, and this is something we will decide with you on a case-by-case basis. Summer Term, 2021: We intend to have students conduct their thesis research in-person during the Summer Term. Some students may opt to conduct thesis research remotely, and again, we will make this determination on a case-by-case basis.

Get a taste of what is to come by joining Zoom meetings for you and your Family:

We invite you to join a series of online zoom meetings. The first, on June 4, will introduce our faculty, showcasing our coursework and its critical relevance to the burden of disease in the US and worldwide. We also invite you to join panel discussions with recent alumni about how their experiences at the IHN shaped their careers. On June 11, current IHN alumni in medical, dental and DO schools will share their experiences and discuss how the IHN MS program contributed to their studying for the MCAT and DAT, and how their IHN education has improved their health professional school learning. Later in the month, we will introduce you to alumni who are pursuing careers in public health, non-profit organizations and start-up industries. Throughout the summer we will host sessions with central offices at Columbia, including Student Health, Financial Aid, and the Library Services. We will also conduct a series of interactive modules designed to have you ‘at the ready’ to optimize your distance learning experience. The faculty and IHN alumni panel discussion series will allow you and your families every opportunity to ask questions as you make the important decision and plans for your future.

Zoom meeting invitations for the June series will follow shortly. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at any time. We are very excited for the prospects of the Columbia IHN MS Class of 2021 and look forward to welcoming you to our IHN family.

Warm regards,

Dr. Sharon Akabas
