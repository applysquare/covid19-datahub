Please see the update message from the Newcastle University Academic Registrar below. Can I also remind you that if you have any queries or concerns, please contact us at AskNUL@ncl.ac.uk

Dear Newcastle University London PGT Students,

I hope you are well.

In this week’s update I provide you with further information on how to access and request library resources. I also highlight a survey that NUSU are conducting on the move to the remote delivery of teaching which I’d be grateful if you could find some time to complete. You can find further details and a link to the survey below.

Finally, I include an important reminder of mental health support services that are available to postgraduate students and details of forthcoming NUSU events for you to look forward to.

Access to the library

We appreciate the importance of library resources and services to the furtherance of your studies. Whilst the closure of the physical libraries has inevitably restricted access to print material, we hope that you are able to maximise your use of our extensive e-resources. There are over half a million e-books and 50,000 journals already available with more being added all the time. If you would like to recommend new books or other resources in your area of interest we will do our best to acquire them for you, but for the moment, we are only sourcing electronic versions rather than print.

Our general library help service is available 24/7 and you can book one to one appointments with a Liaison Librarian for a customised online chat about your information needs.

More information on all library resources and service can be found on the University Library webpages.

Student survey

You will have recently received an email asking you to participate in a University survey. This survey is being run by a team representing Newcastle University Students’ Union (NUSU), the University’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) team and Inclusive Newcastle. The survey will help us to understand the impact of the University’s move to remote delivery and to enhance your online learning experience. We would very much value your participation in this survey which should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Mental health support for postgraduate students

During these unprecedented times you may find that you need extra support. If so, please make use of our Free 24/7 Post Graduate Support Service.
