We recognise that the impact on students will vary depending on the nature of your research, the stage you are at, the timeframe for different lockdown / distancing measures, and your personal circumstances, including caring responsibilities. You and your supervisor should be in regular dialogue about the impact of the COVID-19 situation on your research project, and any work you can be undertaking now or changes that can be made to mitigate the impact. This should be recorded in the Research Student Lifecycle, and will be used to generate a University-wide picture of impact on research students.
