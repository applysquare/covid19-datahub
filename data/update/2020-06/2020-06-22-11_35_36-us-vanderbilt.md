June 11, 2020 – Details of Research Ramp-Up Phase 2 Process

Dear colleagues,

Now that we have completed our preparations for transitioning to Phase 2, I am writing to follow up with you as promised in my June 5 email. We have developed our Phase 2 process with deep engagement by all those in the Vanderbilt University Multi-phase Research Ramp-up Working Group, and with the goal of reducing administrative burdens while ensuring that we have in place the necessary protections against Covid-19. Please note that how you should access the Phase 2 Intake Form will depend on whether you submitted an intake form in Phase 1 AND the type of research activity you seek to perform in Phase 2.

Lead researchers seeking to undertake research activities in non-VU, non-VUMC spaces in the broader Metro Nashville area: Please do NOT submit the Phase 2 Intake Form. Instead, consult your dean’s office to see if an exception can justifiably be considered, and they will direct you regarding next steps. Please do not complete a Phase 2 Intake Form even if you submitted a form during Phase 1 (regardless of whether it was approved or not) and have received a personalized link to the Phase 2 Intake Form.

Lead researchers who did NOT submit a Phase 1 Intake Form and do NOT seek to undertake research activities in non-VU, non-VUMC spaces in the broader Metro Nashville area: Please complete the Phase 2 Intake Form. With the goal of making your Phase 2 ramp-up as streamlined as possible, we have included branching logic in the Phase 2 Intake Form that will allow you to skip items that aren’t relevant to your research activities.

Lead researchers who DID submit a Phase 1 Intake Form and do NOT seek to undertake research activities in non-VU, non-VUMC spaces in the broader Metro Nashville area: You will receive a message to your VU email address with a personalized link to the Phase 2 Intake Form for each project you submitted in Phase 1. This is true even if you submitted a Phase 1 Intake Form but were not approved to begin implementing those plans in Phase 1. We are providing this personalized link to minimize your administrative burden in the ramp-up to Phase 2. The personalized link will allow you to view, copy and revise information you submitted previously through your Phase 1 Intake Form. We also have added branching logic that will allow you to skip items that you’ve answered previously or are not relevant to your research activities. If you do not receive your personalized link(s) to the Phase 2 Intake Form by end of day Friday, June 12, please contact ovpr@vanderbilt.edu for assistance. Further, if you already have been approved to implement your Phase 1 plans, you may continue enacting those plans while you await a response from your supervisor about Phase 2.

If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback on our phased approach for resuming research activities, please reach out to me at ovpr@vanderbilt.edu. I remain deeply committed to facilitating your research and scholarship while keeping Covid-19 at bay.

Sincerely,

Padma
