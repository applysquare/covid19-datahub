**Our campuses will be open in September** - [read our statement](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/statements/2020-2021-academic-year.page) from Professor Mark E. Smith, President and Vice-Chancellor. 

As a university, the wellbeing of our staff and students is always our most important consideration, and never more so than in situations like this.

All colleagues who do not have an essential reason to be on campuses (approved by your Dean or Executive Director) must now work from home. Only a Dean or a Professional Services Director can assign ‘essential’ status to staff. We’ll give all staff with this status a named permit to show they have permission to be on site.
