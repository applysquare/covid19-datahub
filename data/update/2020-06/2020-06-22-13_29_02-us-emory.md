Dear LGS Community, 

Earlier today President Claire Sterk and President-elect Gregory Fenves announced the University’s preliminary plans to offer a mix of on-campus and online instruction in fall 2020. You can find that message [here](http://www.emory.edu/forward/on-campus/message-from-emory-leadership.html). 

The academic calendar will shift to start on August 19, with classes ending by Thanksgiving and exams conducted remotely. The traditional schedule will be further modified by holding classes on Labor Day and eliminating fall break. This change in schedule will affect previously announced dates that will be updated shortly on a revised Registrar’s academic calendar found [here](http://registrar.emory.edu/academic-calendar/index.html).  

All LGS preterm activities will be online and begin on August 10. The LGS New Student Orientation will take place on Monday, August 10\. JPE 600 will take place on Tuesday, August 11, and TATTO 600 will take place on Wednesday, August 12 and Thursday, August 13. We will provide a detailed schedule and additional updates soon. 

The University developed a health and safety plan, based on scientific and public health evidence. Consultations occurred with our own medical, public health, and other experts in scientific areas. Federal, state and local health directives were part of the consultative process, as well. LGS participated in this planning process, which was cautious and thorough. We are guided by two absolute and complementary core principles:  

  * An uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of the Emory community and beyond. 
  * A fervent dedication to the highest quality education.



 **Health and Safety**  

Last month, the University instituted rigorous policies governing the return to campus as part of the [research ramp-up](http://www.emory.edu/coronavirus/emory/return-to-campus/students-return.html). Those policies will remain in effect through fall 2020. In order to maintain low density on campus, it is crucially important for faculty, staff, and students to evaluate their ability to work from home and all are urged to do so, where possible. For those who come to campus, the University will implement a three-pronged strategy to minimize exposure. 

  1.  **Testing:  **All students enrolled in on-campus classes will be required to be tested for COVID-19 shortly before classes begin. Testing will be available at any time during the semester for those who are symptomatic and for their close contacts.  
  2.  **Monitoring:**  All members of the Emory community who come to campus will be required to self-monitor on a daily basis for signs of COVID-19. Trained university staff will conduct random temperature checks ** ** across campus each day. Those individuals with fevers will be required to have a clinical evaluation and to be tested, as appropriate.  
  3.  **Cleaning:  **Strict cleaning protocols for classrooms and other common spaces will be implemented. Students will be appropriately spaced in classrooms and will be required to follow protocols for entering/exiting classrooms to avoid overlap with other students. We will employ multiple measures to ensure cleanliness and safety and will communicate those to the campus community in advance of the resumption of courses. 



It is our collective responsibility to uphold the practices of hygiene, distancing, health testing and reporting of conditions in order to keep ourselves and our community safe. We ask this in the spirit of respect for each other and for what it means to be in community during the time of this pandemic. These include: 

  * Wearing masks in all public places, including labs, classrooms, and offices 
  * Physically distancing at all times 
  * Avoiding campus when ill or feeling ill  
  * Reporting confirmed cases appropriately 
  * Upholding quarantine and isolation protocols, when necessary 
  * Limiting in-person gatherings 



 **Highest Quality Education**  

LGS boasts a world-class faculty committed to teaching and mentoring master’s and doctoral students of the highest caliber. Graduate faculty and graduate students who teach online in fall 2020 will have the benefit of a suite of new training resources offered by the [Center for Faculty Development and Excellence](http://cfde.emory.edu/toolkit/index.html).

LGS remains committed to offering an array of support programs, including writing and language support, community building, professional development and career planning. In fall 2020, these services will be provided virtually in a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions.  Please visit our [diversity](https://www.gs.emory.edu/diversity/index.html) and [professional development](https://www.gs.emory.edu/professional-development/index.html) pages and [weekly LGS notices](https://www.gs.emory.edu/about/newsletterarchive.html) of upcoming events to stay informed and connected.    

In the coming weeks, as programs confirm their fall teaching plans and the University finalizes fall planning, we will keep you informed.  

Finally, the University will send a survey invitation soon. Please take a moment to complete the survey. 

Thank you for your patience and your feedback. We recognize that this is not easy and appreciate your flexibility as we continue to navigate a path forward. Please visit the [LGS website](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/) for updated information. Stay well.  

With you, 

-Lisa
