From the Provost: Plans for Summer II include limited number of on-campus courses

The following message was sent to Mines faculty, staff and students on 5/28/20:

Dear Mines Community:

I am writing today to share our plans for Summer II. I want to thank you all for your understanding and patience as we carefully considered the best options for keeping our students, faculty and staff safe while continuing the work that is necessary to return to on-campus learning in the fall in the fullest capacity possible.

For Summer II, which starts June 22, a few courses (10 total) will have in-person instruction on campus. The remaining courses will continue to be offered through remote delivery or Trefny-designed online courses. The in-person courses will be a mix of 100 percent face-to-face instruction and hybrid models, where lectures are delivered remotely but labs are on campus. For a full list of Summer II courses and their mode of delivery, go to mines.edu/registrar/summer-ii-2020-course-schedule/.

Changes to in-person classrooms and teaching

We estimate that these 10 in-person courses will bring approximately 300 students to campus between June 22 and July 31. We will be implementing changes in the classroom that are similar to what we expect to enact this fall, including:

All students and professors will be required to wear masks or face coverings during all in-person instruction and/or meetings

Classrooms will be reconfigured consistent with social distancing guidelines, with a minimum of ~60 square feet per person, or a 9-foot circle.

Classrooms will be disinfected every evening but we recommend that students carry disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces both before and after use.

We also recommend students carry hand sanitizer to disinfect their hands after touching door knobs etc.

During Summer II, Arthur Lakes Library and computer labs in CTLM will be open with proper social distancing rules in place. The Ben Parker Student Center and Student Recreation Center will remain closed.

As a reminder, current requirements for all those returning to campus can be found on the Environmental Health & Safety website.

All Summer II courses will be taught by Mines faculty using Mines curriculum and students will have ample opportunities to interact with faculty. Students who choose to enroll in Summer II will finish the term just as prepared to move forward in their Mines studies as those in previous summers.

We look forward to welcoming you back to campus and are excited to engage all of you in that transformative, hands-on learning experience that Mines is so well known for.

Go Orediggers!

Richard C. Holz, Professor and Provost
