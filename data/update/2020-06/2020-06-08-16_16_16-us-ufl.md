The State University System today directed Florida public universities to plan alternatives to in-person commencement ceremonies due to continued COVID-19 health guidelines limiting gatherings. We regret the disappointment and inconvenience this will cause for graduates and their families who looked forward to attending the University of Floridaâ€™s rescheduled spring graduation weekend July 31-August 2 or our regularly scheduled summer graduation weekend August 7-8 on campus. We are exploring options for the path forward and will share more details next week.
