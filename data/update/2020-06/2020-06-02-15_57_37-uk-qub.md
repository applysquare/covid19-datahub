As a returning student, we know that you will have many questions about what next year will look like for you. You will know from previous communications that we plan to start the academic year on 21 September 2020 as planned, unless you are on a programme with an earlier start date which you should already know about. Teaching will be a blend of online and face to face – though of course this will very much depend on the social distancing rules in place at the time. Your programme teams are working hard at the moment to complete the assessment and marking process as well as begin to translate your programmes into an accessible online format. Bear with us while we do this – but we will communicate with you what those changes will be and how they will impact with you.
