The University is working hard to ensure that all students achieve the required learning outcomes and gain appropriate experience to progress with their degree programme. We aim to provide those students due to undertake a year-long mandatory placement for study abroad with a Semester 2 experience to replace the whole year experience originally planned. The University is monitoring the situation very closely, and will update students if this changes.

Any implications on your degree classification will depend on what alternative options are available to you. Your School will be able to provide you with advice on academic matters specific to your degree programme and to your individual situation.
