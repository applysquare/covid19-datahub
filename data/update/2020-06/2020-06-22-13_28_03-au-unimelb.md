The University of Melbourne has transitioned to a virtual campus model and weâ€™ve changed the way you attend classes and engage with your University community.

From 30 March until the end of Semester 1, all classes are online so you can study remotely. Please refer to the [LMS](https://lms.unimelb.edu.au) for the details about your classes and assessment for the remainder of Semester 1.

We have plenty of digital tools and services to help you study online and off campus. Visit the [Studying remotely](https://studentit.unimelb.edu.au/studying-remotely) page for information on how best to manage your studies while you're not physically going to classes.
