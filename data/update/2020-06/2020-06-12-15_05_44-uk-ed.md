Due to ongoing global restrictions and to protect the health and safety of our students, the University has made the decision to **cancel all exchange, study abroad, overseas placements, overseas field trips and field work due to commence in semester 1, 2020/21**. We know that this news will be disappointing to you, but your health and safety is our primary concern. We are working to minimise the disruption to your studies and ensure that alternative arrangements are put in place where possible.

At present, placements **due to start** **in semester 2** **of the academic session 2020/21** will go ahead and we aim to provide those students with a year-long mandatory placement for study abroad with a Semester 2 experience to replace the whole year experience originally planned. The University is monitoring the situation very closely, and will update students if this changes.
