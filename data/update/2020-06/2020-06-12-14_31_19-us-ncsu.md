Dear Wolfpack community:

While campus remains fairly quiet with most employees working remotely and students off campus, the work to bring everyone safely back in the fall continues. NC State continues to work closely with public health experts, state officials and the UNC System to ensure our plans are comprehensive and align with best practices and approved guidance.

As university leadership and the 10 reactivation task forces continue working to finalize plans, here are a few updates about recent decisions.

Fall Academic Calendar

As we shared in a previous update, the semester will begin Aug. 10 and end before Thanksgiving. There will be no fall break, and classes will be held Labor Day, Monday, Sept. 7. University offices will remain open.

The last day of classes for the semester will be Friday, Nov. 13. Because of this shortened calendar, the exam schedule and time limits will be compressed. Final exams will take place from Nov. 16-20 with no Reading Day, and will have a maximum time limit of 2.5 hours. Additional information is available here.

Revised Holiday Calendar for Employees

With the revised academic calendar, the university will remain open Labor Day (Sept. 7). To adjust for this change, the holiday will be added to the university’s winter break, which will now begin Dec. 24 and end Jan. 3, 2021. Employees will not be required to use any of their annual leave during the winter break because of this calendar change. More information is available here.

On-Campus Housing Changes and Safety

With the adjusted academic calendar, fall move-in for on-campus housing will be held July 31-Aug. 9 by appointment only. Move-in appointments will occur in three-hour blocks. University Housing shared additional details with students about housing assignment updates, move-in safety and other important information that you can access here.

We are making a limited number of additional single rooms available to assist students who are immunocompromised or who have preexisting medical conditions. Students can submit a request for consideration through the Disability Resource Office.

Packapalooza 2020

After much deliberation, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Packapalooza 2020. We hoped that we could safely hold the event, but to help ensure the health and safety of the campus and broader community, we feel it is in the best interest of all involved to cancel for this year. We plan to be back in 2021, stronger than ever, ready to see Hillsborough Street covered in a sea of red and white.

Classroom Safety

We know that there are many benefits to learning in a face-to-face environment, and NC State remains committed to safely returning to face-to-face instruction for the fall semester. We are making several changes to help protect the health and safety of our faculty and students, including the following:

Classroom capacities are being reduced to allow appropriate physical distancing, and larger classes will be moved online or adjusted to use hybrid delivery methods. We are also taking steps to upgrade classroom technology to ensure faculty can efficiently record and distribute lectures as needed. Depending on the room size, some classrooms may also be equipped with physical barriers in front of lecterns.

Sanitation efforts will also be increased. Our classrooms will be cleaned more often, and there will be plenty of hand sanitizing stations available in all buildings.

Personal Safety

When students, faculty and staff return to campus, expect to see lots of face masks. Students, faculty and staff are expected to wear masks in public spaces where physical distancing is not possible. We have acquired enough masks to ensure that everyone who needs one, has one. We will share more information about the distribution of masks in the coming weeks.

We will also provide campus with more information about best practices and community standards for protecting the community’s health and safety later this summer.

Going Forward

Over the next several weeks, we’ll be providing more information to campus through updates like these, as well as on our homepage. Please continue to stay tuned and stay informed.

Thank you for all you do to keep our community healthy and strong.

Go Pack.
