**EFFECTIVE May 15, 2020:**  The Phase II registration period for Fall 2020 begins on August 8. Incoming first-year students for fall are typically assigned registration time tickets depending on the FASET session they have chosen to attend. Plans for FASET and the related course registration process is under review, and more information will be available soon.
