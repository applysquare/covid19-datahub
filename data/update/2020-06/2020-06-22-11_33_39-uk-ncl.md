Dear Students,

I hope you are well.

This week’s message is aimed at students who may be planning to return to Newcastle to collect belongings.

Keeping you safe in Newcastle

Now that lockdown rules have been relaxed a little, if you are planning to return to Newcastle to collect your belongings, please be mindful of the Government’s guidelines on social distancing, to help control the spread of the Coronavirus.

These latest social distancing guidelines state that you must not:

gather outdoors in groups of more than six people with people you do not live with or, from 13 June, people that are not in your support bubble

visit friends or family inside their home or any other indoor place, except for the limited set of circumstances set out in law or if they are in your support bubble

stay away from your home or your support bubble household overnight - including holidays - except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes

While back in Newcastle, please also be aware of the fact that many of our local residents are elderly and/or have been shielding. Most are also exercising social distancing guidelines. At this very difficult time it is not surprising that sensitivities are heightened and so please do your bit to make sure we all stay safe.

I’d like to thank those students who have worked to support their local communities during the lockdown as actions like these do a lot to enhance our relationships with local residents.

Finally, we are aware that some of you may be planning to take part in one of the many events that have been organised around the country, including Newcastle, for people to express their views about the death of George Floyd and racial discrimination.

These are planned to take place during the day on Saturday and as a result, Newcastle will be busier than usual, so anyone in the city will need to be extra vigilant and take extra care to keep themselves safe. Remember to download the SafeZone app which is free for all students and staff and connects you directly to the University security team when you need help while you are on campus.

Useful information and contact numbers can also be found on our Staff and Student Wellbeing pages.

We will continue to update our FAQs over the next few weeks and if you have any questions that are not answered there, please contact us via Covid19enquiries@ncl.ac.uk.
