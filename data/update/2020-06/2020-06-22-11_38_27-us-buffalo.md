Preparing for Fall 2020

As Interim Vice President for Student Life, I wanted to express how excited I am to welcome students back to our campuses this fall. I know this entire situation has been challenging; however, as we continue to navigate these uncertain times, please know that UB’s Student Life staff has been working every day to prepare for a safe and successful upcoming semester. With the health and safety of our students as our top priority, we will continue our commitment to help guide students through their UB journey.

In light of the recent announcement by President Tripathi and Provost Weber communicating that we will return to campus in a modified, in-person capacity, I continue to be optimistic that we can create a vibrant campus experience this fall. Student Life is committed to providing the best possible resources to support students’ academic setting.

I want to assure you that in order to protect the campus community, we are putting health and safety plans in place, in accordance and compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the New York State Department of Health (DOH). Additional guidance and communication regarding these protocols will be sent to students. You can find important information regarding UB’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and health and safety guidelines on the university’s COVID-19 website.

Our Student Guide in preparation for a return to campus this fall will keep you informed on the most up-to-date information, as it becomes available. Our staff is committed to providing support and essential student services regardless of classroom and housing restrictions necessitated by social distancing. You have my assurance that we are implementing a comprehensive plan that works with the best interests of our students and campus community in mind, creating a dynamic living and learning experience for those who call UB home.

Life on campus will look different in many ways, so collaboration between students, parents, faculty and staff will continue to be essential to move UB forward. Thank you, again, for your resiliency, patience and commitment as we embark on this unprecedented year – TOGETHER.

Sincerely

Christina R. Hernandez

Interim Vice President for Student Life
