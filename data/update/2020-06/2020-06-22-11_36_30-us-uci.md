June 11, 2020

Dear UC Irvine Student Athlete,

First and foremost, we are incredibly proud of every one of you for how you have adapted to these unexpected and unprecedented times. In fact, the entire University takes pride in how you are continuing to represent our institution in a first-class manner. Please know that UCI remains committed to helping you continue to flourish academically, athletically, and personally. As such, we will soon be sharing a survey instrument to allow all student-athletes to provide feedback and insights on your current and continuing needs in each of these areas.

UCI is continuing to plan for the return of athletics training and competition. We are committed to sharing with you the best information we have as it becomes available. In the meantime, there are a few items we want to communicate to you:

Classes and Instruction

In a message to the UCI community, Chancellor Gillman confirmed that the academic year will begin as scheduled on September 28, 2020 and outlined guiding principles for in-person operations.

As indicated in the Zotmail sent to all students today, undergraduate coursework will again be offered remotely for Fall 2020. No decisions have been made related to the Winter 2021 or Spring 2021 quarters.

While remote learning may seem like a concept borne from the pandemic, UCI has offered online coursework for more than a decade. We are considered a leader in innovative instruction, with esteemed members of our faculty developing more than 200 online courses, and we actively invest in the development and improvement of new teaching methods that shape the future of education. The recently established Online Learning Research Center is dedicated to providing evidence-based resources and defining best practices for educators, students, and researchers throughout the world. The center’s work and other innovative approaches are applied through our Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation, which partners with faculty and educators to develop exceptional learning experiences for our students, regardless of the setting.

Housing for 2020

On-campus housing will be open Fall 2020. Athletics has worked closely with campus leadership, and there are plans for housing opportunities as it relates to preseason fall teams (men’s and women’s cross country, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s volleyball, men’s water polo) training, summer access (men’s and women’s basketball), and opportunities for the 2020-21 academic year. To this end, all student-athletes should apply for housing, as appropriate, through the campus’ application process or local apartment leasing office. You should also communicate your anticipated interest residence (home, apartment, or on-campus) with your respective head coach. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees, informing your coach of your interest allows for consideration as the campus models inventory and availability.

Athletic related conditioning or practice for summer 2020 and 2020-21 academic year

As noted above, the state of California, University of California, Irvine, Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, Conference affiliates (Big West Conference MPSF, GCC) and National Collegiate Athletic Association’s commitment is to protect the health and safety of college student- athletes, coaches, administrators and fans. Under expert medical professional recommendations, Athletics is establishing protocols for reengaging in athletic-related activities. As soon as we receive any relevant information or make any pertinent decisions, we will communicate with you as quickly as possible.

Voluntary Workouts

One opportunity that has recently made permissive by the NCAA is on-campus voluntary conditioning. Based on the NCAA action, you will receive a separate communication through ARMS. It will be an educational message on voluntary activity and acknowledgement statement indicating your understanding that engaging in workouts on our campus during June (or during any other out-of-season period this summer) means you are doing so voluntarily. All student-athletes who wish to use our facilities voluntarily during the summer must complete this acknowledgement via ARMS. The workflow has not been released. Again, we do not have the official start date for voluntary training. We are still establishing protocols and need campus approval. When we have specific details to share, we will communicate with you directly. We, respectfully, request that you wait until given permission to train before showing up on-campus.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if we can be helpful to you. I personally wish you the best as you finish this academic year and look forward to seeing you once again back on campus.

Be well, Be safe, Be Positive.

#ZotON!

Paula Smith

Director of Intercollegiate Athletics
