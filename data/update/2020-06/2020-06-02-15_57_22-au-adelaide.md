Students will be able to complete an ‘exam error’ survey in the applicable MyUni Exam course. The survey will ask for a brief description of the issue that you have encountered with the exam question/s. This information will go to the Course Coordinator at the point of marking.

We recommend students complete the survey once you have completed/submitted your exam. If you believe there is an error in a question, in the first instance you are advised to work on other questions, and return to this question later. Students will have until 11.59 pm on the day of the exam to submit the survey.
