No. Some students may already be in a position where they are carrying too many failed credits from Semester 1 in order to progress, or may be found to have failed courses taken this semester, which means they are not in a position to progress. Students who are unable to progress may be offered additional assessment during the summer vacation. If this affects you, your School will contact you directly to explain what will happen.

Please note that there will be no reassessment fee for undergraduate students taking additional assessments in August 2020.
