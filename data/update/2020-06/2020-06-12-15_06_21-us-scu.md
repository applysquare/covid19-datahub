The following message was emailed to the campus community on June 5, 2020.

Dear Santa Clara University community,

As we prepare for the celebrations that typically signify the end of an academic year, our hearts are heavy for the pain endured by our Black brothers and sisters. We stand with them in our commitment to end racial injustice. On Monday, Fr. O’Brien [addressed](https://www.scu.edu/kob/racial-injustice-msg/) the Santa Clara family, both as president and as a Jesuit priest caring for this community. On Tuesday, our University community came together at a [Vigil for Racial Justice](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__santaclarauniversity.hosted.panopto.com_Panopto_Pages_Viewer.aspx-3Fid-3D65c82e3e-2Df694-2D46a7-2Dbe7b-2Dabcb00e272b5&d=DwMFaQ&c=iVyFbx9TtkoGWXYs40w9MA&r=9k5n2oPyzqhG-S_A75SOaw&m=3bTmZPL5BZ6B7kI-5Xa6jItPLozUQTFRfdTGKRt4bPY&s=AOoD9bweoIfi1I7rUtk7AG8Ppwi3WyJIdEelY-QgwQo&e=), where we stood in solidarity with our Black students, faculty, staff and alumni and pledged our commitment to action. A website that captures [resources](https://www.scu.edu/diversity/racial-justice-resources/) shared by the SCU community will be continuously updated.

We provide below, a digest of updates and guidance for the weeks ahead.

**CARES Act:** The University continues to review student applications for funds from the federal stimulus package, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. CARES Act requests are being reviewed in the order received, and are currently taking **approximately 3-4 weeks to process.** Once a determination has been made about a request, applicants will receive an email message with additional information. **To date** , 1,489 students have requested $2,024,573 in funding; $898,356 has been approved and disbursed. The CARES Act application is available through[ eCampus](http://ecampus.scu.edu/) and a dedicated[ CARES Act Relief Fund FAQ page](http://www.scu.edu/covid-19/cares-act-relief-fund-faqs/) has additional information. The FAQ contains information for students who have applied already. 

**Spring 2020 Move-Out Update:** A reminder that all students currently or previously residing in campus housing must **make arrangements to have their belongings removed from their residence hall or neighborhood unit by July 12** , if they have not done so already.

All students can now request a move-out appointment to retrieve their belongings from their residence hall through July 12. Students can move out by returning to campus, designating a proxy to remove their belongings, or contracting with[ the external vendor Bronco Student Services](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.broncoss.com_pack-2Dup&d=DwMFaQ&c=iVyFbx9TtkoGWXYs40w9MA&r=9k5n2oPyzqhG-S_A75SOaw&m=3bTmZPL5BZ6B7kI-5Xa6jItPLozUQTFRfdTGKRt4bPY&s=NiN-LJt9bo3RGGpHNI_MLIdYSFSzhxP6kAxy8_F8agY&e=) to pack/store/ship their belongings. Although appointments will be scheduled through July 12, **students must finalize their move-out plans by Friday, June 19** (i.e., request a move-out appointment, designate a proxy, or contract with Bronco Student Services). Please review the Housing Office’s[ Spring 2020 Move-Out Information](https://www.scu.edu/living/spring-move-out/) for details on how to sign up for a move-out time and properly move out of your residential space, including rules for following  all social distancing guidelines set forth by Santa Clara County. Additionally, once all belongings have been removed from the student’s residence hall room, students must also **complete the Check-Out Agreement** within the Housing Portal in[ eCampus](https://ecampus.scu.edu/).

**Off-Campus Student Information:** Students who live in non-University off-campus housing are encouraged to work with their property managers and make arrangements for a safe move-out. The City of Santa Clara is having a **special garbage collection** (for a fee) in the neighborhood surrounding the SCU campus. This bulky-item collection service will take place on June 24 and June 29. Please see this [flyer](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/student-life/off-campus-living/University-Extra-Collection-Notice-2020-COVID-Language.pdf) for additional information.
