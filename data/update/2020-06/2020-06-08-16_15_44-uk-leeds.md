We’re continuing to share lots of tips and information through students.leeds.ac.uk( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/?utm_source=studentnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter5february&utm_campaign=spring20 ), our Facebook group for current students( https://www.facebook.com/groups/uolcurrentstudents/ ) and @UoLStudents on Twitter( https://twitter.com/UoLStudents ).
 
Exams

Finished them this week, or last one tomorrow? Well done! Who would have thought back in September that we’d be finishing our academic year in these circumstances? Whichever year you’re in, and however it has finished, with online exhibitions, no exams, or online exams – you did it! Here’s the exam and assessment information( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10111/examinations_and_assessment ) should you need it, but remember you can also speak with your school if you’ve got any specific questions regarding marking or results. 
 
What’s happening with next term and graduations?

We really, really want to be back on campus, and we hope we can welcome you back very soon. Different teams, services and departments are working hard to find all the ways they can to make sure you’ll be able to return to campus soon in a way that keeps you and those around you safe, and also meets the government requirements. 

As you can imagine, it’s not simply unlocking buildings; significant arrangements and changes have to be made to ensure the safety of everyone. Some of you may be shielding and have health conditions that mean you’re at risk or have specific needs, and so the University needs to get things in place so we can support you. We’ll be continuing to communicate with you via email over the next few weeks (and months) as arrangements are made. We know it’s a cause of concern and frustration for some of you, and so thanks for your patience. We will be together again soon, and we can’t wait!

Graduation

After so much hard work, graduation ceremonies on campus are normally the perfect way to celebrate your achievements. As we’ve already announced, the ceremonies are postponed this summer. However, as well as rearranging the celebrations for a time when we can all be safe and be together with our families and friends, we’re hoping to arrange smaller online celebrations on our social media channels over the summer when you receive your certificates through the post – the graduation team will be in touch with you about these over the next month or so.
 
Accommodation update

University Halls of residence

If you’re currently a resident in University halls, and have left your belongings in your room when you want home, from Monday 1 June, we are advising that you can return to your accommodation to collect any belongings( https://accommodation.leeds.ac.uk/info/9/current_residents/111/collecting_your_belongings ) you may have left. Don’t forget you’ll need to check current government advice before travelling( https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#is-your-journey-necessary ).

Private accommodation

If you’re in private accommodation, Leeds University Union (LUU) have launched a joint campaign with the other Leeds Universities called Leeds Student Rent Relief( https://sites.google.com/luu.org.uk/leeds-student-rent-relief/home ). It’s designed to help support you and provide you with guidance with financial hardship you may be having. If you don’t find the answer, there’s contact details too in case you have specific questions.

Moving out

Currently, being able to donate your unwanted belongings to charity isn’t really possible. The UK Government has suggested that charity shops will re-open from June 15; however be aware not all of them will be open on this date, and also may not be able to take donations. As such, begin making plans for how you can sort your belongings when you move out of your accommodation. Please dispose of unwanted items responsibly and sustainably. We’ll share with you any updates, ideas and opportunities we hear of to help you move out as we hear of them.
