For finalists who will not be returning next year and are unable to leave books with fellow students, you can leave books at one of the accommodation sites (under the archway at Jarratt Hall, Leos Lounge at Pritchatts Park Village or the Vale Reception) if you are coming to collect your belongings.  
  
Please note: 

  * Books should be placed in a bag/envelope with your name, ID number and the date of return noted inside.
  * Books will remain on your account for a while, until library staff are able to return to campus.

### New Barber exhibition ‘Sights of Wonder: Photographs from the 1862 Royal Tour’

Pyramids, sphinxes, temples and shrines: breath-taking views of these ancient and often iconic landmarks, captured by pioneering Victorian photographer Francis Bedford, feature in the Barber's first ever online-only exhibition, launching today.  
  
Francis Bedford joined Albert Edward – the Prince of Wales and future King Edward VII - on a four-month journey ordered by Queen Victoria, through the eastern Mediterranean in 1862. His innovative photographs were exhibited on their return to a public excited to see sites they had only ever seen before in prints and paintings.  
  
This is the third exciting annual collaboration with Royal Collection Trust curated by University of Birmingham Masters' students.  
  
[Enter the exhibition](https://sightsofwonder.barber.org.uk/).
