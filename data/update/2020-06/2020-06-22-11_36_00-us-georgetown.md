Georgetown Law today announced preliminary plans for the coming fall semester that would allow students to attend classes on campus.

The Fall 2020 model will also allow students who prefer to, or need to, participate remotely to do so – for any reason, and provides special programming to build community.

The school’s plan to resume in-person learning includes an unprecedented move to small class sizes for full-time, first-year law students. In most cases, fall 1L classes will shrink to fewer than 40 students, which will allow for in-person learning that follows public health guidance on physical distancing. As a result, students will have enhanced opportunities to engage with classmates, professors, and the course content.

All classes will shift to a remote learning environment starting Thanksgiving week, extending through the end of the fall semester and final examinations.

The Fall 2020 plans are subject to approval by the District of Columbia, and may be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the public health situation and governmental guidance. Plans for the Spring 2021 semester will be announced later this year.

In messages sent to students, Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor said, “Our goal for the fall is to restore as much of the energy of our campus life as we are allowed. Of course, we will do that with the community’s well-being and safety front and center, following the best advice of our health experts and adhering closely to the evolving public health restrictions imposed by the District and federal governments.”

Plans for operating Georgetown Law’s on-campus housing, sport & fitness center, cafeteria, law library, and other common facilities are still under development and will be announced in the coming weeks.

Georgetown’s President John J. DeGioia also sent a message on Georgetown’s Fall 2020 planning.
