As announced last week, at the direction of the State University System due to COVID-19, UF will not hold in-person summer or in-person rescheduled spring graduation ceremonies in July and August as originally planned.

For summer graduates, the university plans to recognize and celebrate every graduate with a virtual commencement weekend on August 14-15, the last weekend of the summer semester. More details will be available soon at [commencement.ufl.edu](http://www.commencement.ufl.edu/).

Additionally, the university will provide every spring and summer graduate an opportunity to participate in a future in-person commencement ceremony once we are able to safely resume our regularly scheduled commencement ceremonies. When that will be remains uncertain, but the university will contact graduates once we are confident in-person ceremonies can resume. We look forward to welcoming you back and to celebrating you whenever it becomes possible.
