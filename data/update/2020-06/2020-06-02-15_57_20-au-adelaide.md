Online examinations in Trimester 1 and Semester 1, where set, will be open-book, time-limited exams, administered through MyUni.

Guidelines for the design and operation of online exams are being developed, taking into account the need to maintain high quality process and academic integrity, provide appropriate technical and other support, allow students to raise issues, and to minimise anxiety and disruption for both staff and students.

A University-wide approach will be required to ensure all these principles are met through good design of exams and clear processes. This will be communicated to faculties and students as soon as possible.

Note that assessment alternatives have been put in place by many courses, to remove the need for students to sit an exam. Information on the assessment required for your course is detailed in MyUni.
