## Academic Operations Status

**EFFECTIVE  MAY 4, 2020:** All institutions within the University System of Georgia, including Georgia Tech, will continue online courses during May and the summer semesters, with only limited exceptions. Limited campus operations also continue to be in place until further notice, with only minimal staff physically on-site to ensure continuity of certain services.

As such, programming, events, and services traditionally held on Georgia Techâ€™s campus during the summer have been moved online, postponed, or canceled.
