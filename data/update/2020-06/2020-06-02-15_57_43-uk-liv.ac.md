We anticipate introducing a hybrid model of learning that would provide the best student experience while accounting for appropriate social distancing and hygiene regimes. In such a model you would receive a mix of face-to-face teaching in smaller group classes and laboratories (not large lectures) and virtual teaching sessions.

Academic colleagues across the institution are working hard to think through how each of your programmes is delivered to ensure the best possible experience. We are distinct from many other universities in having a long and established track record of highly regarded postgraduate online learning provision and we will be putting this experience to good use as we develop our plans.

As previously indicated, these plans mean that our ability to deliver some modules during 2020/21 and the ability to deliver some content or assessment types within a given module may be subject to change. Please be assured that where this is the case, students will be informed directly, and all reasonable steps will be taken to mitigate the effects that this may have. In some cases, students may already have been contacted by their School Office to discuss making alternative module registration arrangements.
