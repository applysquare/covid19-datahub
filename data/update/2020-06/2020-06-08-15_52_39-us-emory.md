May 29, 2020 4:56 PM May 29: Updates from Laney Gradate School - Return to Research at Lower Density Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Members of the Laney Graduate School Community: As you know, Emory has initiated a plan to gradually return to campus, beginning with a phased return to research facilities at a lower density. LGS has continued to work with University leadership to establish an effective and comprehensive clearance process for students to be part of this return. The plan ensures students are equipped with the knowledge and understanding of public health safety protocols and affirm their readiness to return to laboratory research and research in other settings. Over the next week, lists from research units will be submitted to and processed by the Office of the Provost. As LGS receives the lists, students who were identified by their advisor/mentor and approved by their research unit as part of the limited return to research facilities will receive an email from LGS to begin the clearance process to return to campus. Students should not come to campus until they have completed the full process. Students who were previously exempted and allowed to conduct essential research on campus must also be identified as part of the limited return by their advisor/mentor and then will complete this clearance process too. All others should engage in remote activity to continue academic progress. To protect the health and safety of the Emory community, it is critical to maintain a low density of people on campus. Students should not come to campus unless they have received prior approval to do so and have completed the required clearance process. As the University prepares to move into the next phases of on-campus activity, other facilities and services that support research and teaching may also be approved to reopen in limited ways. When these plans develop, we will update you. -- Lisa A. Tedesco, Ph.D. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs – Graduate Studies Dean, James T.

May 26, 2020 9:06 AM Return to Research at Lower Density Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff As you know, Emory University has initiated a multi-phased plan to gradually return to campus to support our missions of research and teaching. The plan begins with a return to research at lower density. Over the past month, the various schools and colleges, as well as research, academic, and administrative support units have worked very hard to prepare for the first wave of researchers to return to campus. We want to provide you with an overview of where we are. The target date for metered, small-scale research activity to resume is May 28, 2020. Only those faculty and staff who are identified as part of the selected research efforts, as well as those who had previously been identified as essential to work on campus, will be approved to return to campus. All others should continue to work remotely. It is critical to maintain a low density of people on campus at this time to protect the health and safety of those whose work requires them to be on campus. Do not come to campus unless you have received prior approval to do so and have completed the required clearance process described below. Over the next month, other functions and services may also be approved to return. As these plans are completed and if you are needed to return to campus, you will be notified by your supervisor and HR. During the initial ramp up phase, visitors to campus will be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel will remain in effect, except as approved by the Office of the Provost for research purposes. Emory is implementing health and safety measures to protect faculty, staff and students who will be returning to work on campus. Each of the individuals who will be working on campus has a critical role to play in keeping the campus safe. Health and Safety Measures Working with the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response (CEPAR), the Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHSO), the Office of Injury Management (OIM), Student Health Services (SHS), Emory Healthcare colleagues, and Emory medical and public health experts, and in compliance with state and local public health and regulatory guidance, Emory has taken a number of actions to protect the health of our community. These actions include: Development of a mandatory confidential screening questionnaire to assess the health of faculty and staff prior to their return to campus.

Escalation of frequent cleaning and disinfection of all public spaces, including Emory shuttles. Provision of supplies for cleaning, face coverings, and other necessary PPE. It is important to note that maintaining the health and safety of those working on campus is highly dependent on each of us rigorously observing the required individual behaviors. These behaviors are outlined in the Return to Campus Guidelines. This guide also contains helpful information about working on campus. It is critical that those of us who are returning, and those of us who have already been working regularly on campus, follow certain steps as part of the return process. This requirement applies even if you are only working occasionally on campus. You will receive a separate communication that gives you specific instructions about this, but the required steps include: Review and acknowledge an understanding of the expectations and guidelines as you return to campus.

Review and acknowledge an understanding of the expectations and guidelines as you return to campus. Complete necessary training that gives guidance about physical distancing, face covering and other PPE, hygiene, self-monitoring for symptoms, and other important health and safety aspects.

Ensure your mobile phone number is up to date in the Emergency Notification System in PeopleSoft Self Service. If you have not enrolled in the Emergency Notification System, you will be required to do so. Provide a list of “close contacts” through a PeopleSoft Self Service module. This is a key part of the contact tracing process. Clearly, we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our community’s safety during the return to research at a lower density. Whether you are returning to campus or continuing to work remotely, we thank you for your commitment to Emory during these challenging times. Attachment: Return to Research at Lower Density

May 22, 2020 5:30 PM Updates from Laney - Return to campus for research framework Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Members of the Laney Graduate School Community: LGS continues to work with University leadership and faculty leaders across campus to refine the process we will use for students to affirm their readiness and facility safety to return to resume laboratory research and research in other settings. The LGS form will look for three pieces of information from graduate students. Confirmation that re-entry into an Emory research facility is needed for your academic progress. The LGS form will require you to upload an email sent to you from your Advisor, cc-d to your Director of Graduate Studies or Program Director, affirming that your access at this stage meets the academic criterion provided in the research return guidance: “Graduate students will be allowed to return to laboratories that have been cleared for limited reopen, and only where critically necessary to maintain or establish research initiatives related to their academic progress.”



Confirmation that the facility has been approved for limited re-opening in accordance with the guidance from the Office of the Provost. This approval process will be initiated by the department, school or unit that houses a specific facility, and must be centrally verified. The process of re-opening will happen in a limited and phased way for different kinds of facilities in different areas across campus.



Confirmation that you have completed the University-required training to ensure compliance with COVID-19 safety standards in your research environment . The training will be required of any member of the Emory community entering facilities during this phase. The LGS form will ask you to upload a certificate that is generated at the conclusion of the training. Once all elements of the process for the Office of the Provost have been completed, LGS will open the form, using the three items above, for graduate students to submit their affirmation and statement of readiness to re-enter research facilities. Our concern is for your safety and the safety of those you work with. We will open the LGS process when all elements are in place and can be easily verified. Best, Lisa --- Lisa A. Tedesco, Ph.D. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs – Graduate Studies Dean, James T. Laney School of Graduate Studies Professor, Rollins School of Public Health Emory University

May 19, 2020 4:20 PM Emory Updates on Fall Semester Status and Leadership Compensation Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear Emory community, I hope this message finds you safe and well. We are writing to provide updates for you on two important matters. We know that everyone’s first question is the status of the fall semester. Answering that question is the focus of our daily work, as we plan for what we hope will be in-person instruction, albeit with many important adaptations and protections in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within our community. This work is guided by the principles for decision making that we discussed during last month’s town hall. While we would like to share with you a definitive decision about our status for the fall, we are simply not yet prepared to do so and likely cannot for some weeks. However, we commit to providing an update on our progress by June 15. As was shared during last month’s town hall, we continue to assess the financial impact COVID-19 will have on the university. While we anticipate an approximately $10 million shortfall for our current fiscal year due to lost revenue related to the suspension of mission-related activities, costs related to supporting students’ financial needs, faculty and staff salary continuation, and new incurred COVID-19 related costs, we do not know the full scope of loss for the upcoming fiscal year. As we approach the traditional beginning of the fall semester, we expect a clearer financial picture, but we should not wait any longer to implement additional financial measures that will help mitigate additional losses. In keeping with our decision-making principles, noted above, we are writing today to share the first of what will be several actions in the coming months. Effective July 1, President Sterk, the President’s Leadership Team and the deans will reduce their compensation by 15 percent. This reduction, which will be subject to review at the end of calendar year 2020, is not just a cost-savings step, but also a representation of the commitment the leadership team has to preserving Emory’s academic and research missions in the face of financial challenges. Thank you for your continued resilience during these uncertain times and for your patience as we thoughtfully and systematically work through many decisions for our Emory community to continue to move forward this Fall.

Sincerely, Claire E. Sterk, President Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare

May 18, 2020 3:18 PM May 18: Laney - Return to campus for research framework Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Members of the Laney Graduate School Community: First, let me express my sincere wishes for your health and the health of your loved ones. I spent much of the weekend signing master’s theses and doctoral dissertations, and I continue to be moved by the breadth and depth of scholarship produced by Laney Graduate School students. Even in these unspeakable times, graduate students relentlessly push the boundaries of our knowledge in exciting directions. On Friday, May 15, the Office of the Provost released a Return to Campus for Research Framework, a phased plan informed by public health guidance, pragmatism, and caution. If you have not read the document, I urge you to do so. You will find it here. To support this plan, LGS is developing a simple form to be completed by graduate students who decide to return to research facilities that have been approved for re-opening by the appropriate departments, offices, schools, or units. The form will be posted Friday, May 22. In Phase 2, starting on May 31, once a facility has been approved for limited opening, graduate students will gain access only if their presence is determined to be “critically necessary to maintain or establish research initiatives related to their academic progress” by their advisor and Director of Graduate Studies or Program Director. As Emory evaluates our readiness for Phase 3, on-campus research facilities, including libraries and other areas, may become available to a broader segment of graduate students, insofar as mitigation protocols for different facilities can sustain increased density. Detailed instructions will be available on Friday, May 22, with the form. In the meantime, stay in close touch with your advisors and your DGS or PD. And stay well. With best regards, Lisa

May 15, 2020 9:33 AM Resumption of Research -- Plan for Phased Return to Campus Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear members of the Emory community, Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Emory’s focus has been on the academic continuity of the university while protecting the health and safety of our faculty, staff, students, and trainees. This communication is to let you know that beginning immediately, Emory University will commence a multi-phased plan to gradually return to campus for research. As described below, the first phase involves planning at the levels of schools and colleges as well as research support units. Safely resuming additional on-campus and community-based research activities is crucial to our mission to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity. What we learn will inform our decisions about how and when to return to campus for other activities, including teaching and learning. Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all members of our community and campus visitors. Our overarching and long-range goals include a return to on-campus, clinical and community-based research, teaching, and learning as soon as it is safe to do so. To be clear, our campus is presently a safe place , but higher levels of activity will require implementation of a variety of public health measures that necessitate careful planning and monitoring. We will use all available public health data and guidance as well as data relating specifically to the health and safety of the Emory community to inform decisions and make any necessary updates or adjustments to this plan. This means that our plans may change. Circumstances may require us to adjust timelines, change venues, and shift the format of our planned activities, but our priorities, commitments, and values will be unwavering: we will deliver extraordinary educational and research outcomes while implementing the highest standards of care for the well-being of our community. The following plan outlines how we will do this together. In making this announcement, we want to underscore what this togetherness entails—we have a shared responsibility for implementing the practices that will support our collective success. Activities to be supported The return to campus to support research in all its forms—physical laboratory and non-laboratory (clinical and epidemiological), funded and non-funded, humanistic, creative, and social scientific, as well as libraries and core facilities, and offices both local and global—must be done gradually and pragmatically based on the best medical, scientific, and public health evidence. It should also be informed by our institutional commitments to support and maintain progress for students and trainees, and to diversity, equity, and inclusion as we make decisions that necessitate prioritization and the exercise of authority and oversight. Re-engagement of research and scholarly activities must also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies. The larger principles for decision-making that are informing the university return to campus research activity will also guide this effort. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic remains dynamic. All steps in this process are subject to legal and public health contingencies, such as new governmental restrictions or other public health measures that emerge in response to a resurgence. To support effective communication, necessary collaboration, and clear designation of responsibilities, a return to campus calendar is detailed in the Return to Campus for Research Framework documents, and will be updated and maintained on the university website. Implementation dates and procedures may need to be adapted to fit community- and public health-circumstances. Thus, activities should be resumed with resilience strategies in mind to minimize set-backs in the event of revisions to the calendar or process. Resumption of campus- and community-based research activity will be linked with a systematic approach to detecting and controlling the spread of infection in the Emory community. Human Resources (HR) will provide a process to support those with underlying conditions or living situations that put them at greater risk for infection or severe complications from the disease. Those working in clinical partner sites should follow the instructions and requirements for the specific facilities: Emory Healthcare (Login Required)

Grady Health System (Login Required)

Atlanta VA Health System

Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Key strategies A robust practice of health monitoring and testing will be combined with public health guidance for mitigating risk. Data will inform real-time assessment of whether and when to advance in the staged recovery efforts. Phases Progress through phases will be determined by the Office of the Provost in consultation with the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs. Decisions about changes in phases will take into account guidance and data from the CDC and from local public health authorities. Phase 1: Preliminary Planning & Assessment of Readiness (Immediately-May 27) Phase 1 involves a review of guidance by the Office of the Provost in the Return to Campus for Research Framework. The various schools and colleges as well as research and academic support units on campus are tasked with preparing unit-specific planning documents to identify faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows and trainees who will participate in increased activity necessary for the support of research on campus. Among the plans to be developed are those providing for the limited reopening of critical research facilities such as research cores, libraries, the museum, and laboratories. While we implement Phase 1, all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely should continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor. Visitors to campus are prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Additionally, the suspension of all university-sponsored travel remains in effect. Phase 2: Metered Small-Scale Restart (May 28-June 21) Based on what we learn from Phase 1 and our assessments of operational readiness, we will work to carefully bring back additional personnel to increase capacity and functionality as needed to support core academic operations and related student services. The target date for commencement of this phase is May 28, 2020. During this phase, we expect to include, once approved, postdoctoral fellows and trainees as well as graduate students in return to research-related campus activities. Once again, it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor. It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be prohibited, and our buildings will remain card-access only. Suspension of all university-sponsored travel is expected to remain in effect. The data we collect as part of Phases 1 and 2 will inform our assessments of both the health and safety of the community and our institutional operational capacity to support greater numbers of students, faculty, and staff on campus. What we learn from these two phases will make us more resilient and capable in the months ahead. Phase 3: Expansion of Activity (June 22-date to be determined) On or about June 22, 2020, we are planning for a metered and monitored re-opening of broader on-campus research activities aligned with university guidelines to maintain a sustainable total population density on campus. Local population densities monitored by local unit leaders, in collaboration as required for shared-use facilities, including: Faculty (per guidelines from dean/director/chair);

Staff required on campus to perform their duties;

on campus to perform their duties; Postdocs and related trainees; and

Graduate and professional students (per guidelines from the Laney Graduate School and relevant dean). Once again, it will be important for all faculty and staff who are able to work remotely to continue to do so unless otherwise instructed by their dean, department or program director, or supervisor. It is expected that during this phase, visitors to campus will continue to be restricted, and our buildings will remain card-access only. At this time, we will revisit suspension of university-sponsored travel. The Return to Campus for Research Framework was developed through a collaborative and highly consultative process arising from the activities of the Faculty and Research Academic Continuity Group led by Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Tim Holbrook, and Vice Provost for Strategic Research Initiatives Lanny Liebeskind. We are deeply grateful for their leadership and for the contributions of many others who participated in the planning activities. We will continue to communicate decisions, updates and next steps once available, and thank you for your help in bringing Emory together again. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Jon Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs

May 13, 2020 2:03 PM Emory Celebrates Staff Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear Emory community, We’ve been proud to see Emory faculty and staff continually working to support our students, maintain essential campus operations and help Emory discover innovative new ways to achieve its mission during the pandemic. The path forward hasn’t always been easy. But we’ve been impressed to watch our campus communities — comprised of more than 12,600 staff and faculty members — working together with dedication, professionalism and unflagging energy to make it happen. Our appreciation also goes out to the courageous health care employees who put their own health at risk working on the front lines of the current pandemic, from healers and hospital chaplains to cleaning crews and those who keep patients fed and well-cared for. To recognize these outstanding efforts, Emory Report has launched “All Hands on Deck,” a series that profiles individuals who are working tirelessly behind the scenes to help Emory during the COVID-19 pandemic. From police officers who keep our campus safe and faculty members who’ve swiftly transitioned to remote teaching to staff members at the Michael C. Carlos Museum who’ve created new ways to share exhibits online with the public, Emory staff and faculty are doing what is required to keep our institution operating every day. Sometimes, the work is invisible. But many hands make it happen. And so often, the success of keeping Emory open and functioning rests squarely upon the shoulders of those who aren’t in the spotlight. Please know that we see you. If you would like to recognize an Emory staff or faculty member — or a group of individuals — for going above and beyond to navigate the current crisis, a new web-based tool is available to provide a public shout-out. Submissions may be offered anonymously or with a name; all submissions will be reviewed by Emory Human Resources and shared here. To thank an Emory Health Hero, or share a note of encouragement, we invite you to leave a note here. Typically, this is the week when we celebrate the end of the academic year by gathering on the Emory Quad for Staff Fest, an annual community celebration filled with food, activities and fun. A time-honored tradition, the Emory Staff Fest has brought us together for the past 41 years. And while we may not be able to gather physically quite yet, we can still come together as a community to celebrate each other and the successes of the past academic year. With a theme of “Stronger Together,” Emory’s 42nd annual Staff Fest will take place from 12 to 2 p.m. on Friday, May 15 — our first ever virtual celebration. Please take a break from your workday, slip on a favorite Staff Fest t-shirt from years past and reconnect with co-workers with engaging, interactive activities that focus on fun and wellbeing. Festivities kick off at noon with a special message from Emory President Claire E. Sterk. You can step outside to participate in a virtual fun run/walk, join a team for an Emory trivia challenge, participate in Zumba and WERQ dance fitness classes, learn about healthy eating at home, and more. A full schedule of activities can be found on the Staff Fest website. To Emory faculty, staff and health care workers, please take a moment to celebrate your own contributions, all that you’ve done to help us make it through a challenging academic year — both those working at home and employees who are still on campus. Your hard work not only inspires others, it helps set a standard for educational excellence. For all that you do, we thank you.

Sincerely, Claire E. Sterk, President Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

May 6, 2020 10:25 AM Celebration of Commencement and University Awards Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, In the life of a university, Commencement is a time for celebration and reflection — an opportunity to recognize the fulfillment of long-held goals and dreams, the transformational arc of the academic journey and the supportive community that has made it all possible. As we prepare to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the Class of 2020, we also want to take time to recognize the essential work of the entire campus community in seeing us through an academic year that has presented historic challenges. For demonstrating the resolve and perseverance needed to make this happen, we thank you. Beyond recognizing the considerable achievements of our students, Emory’s Commencement exercises have also traditionally offered a public forum to honor faculty and staff members with the presentation of university awards for exceptional teaching, leadership, citizenship and distinguished service. In the coming days, you will learn more about these major university awards and about the inspirational individuals who will be receiving them this year. These awards represent some of the most prestigious honors bestowed by the university. For students, they include the Marion Luther Brittain Award, Emory’s highest student honor, and the Lucius Lamar McMullan Award. For faculty and staff, university honors include the Thomas Jefferson Award, the Exemplary Teacher Award, the Emory Williams Teaching Award, the Provost’s Distinguished Teaching Award and the George P. Cuttino Award for Excellence in Mentoring, among many others. We hope you’ll join us in expressing our heartfelt admiration and gratitude to this year’s award recipients for their extraordinary commitment to enriching the intellectual and civic life of the Emory community, which is foundational to our academic mission. For all that you do, we thank you. The qualities these individuals embody help to make Emory what it is today — a vibrant incubator for the creation and sharing of knowledge, a community deeply rooted in service and civic impact, and an innovative academic leader in both scientific research and the humanities. For the entire Emory community, this time of year brings us closer — if not physically, certainly emotionally — as the larger community joins with students and their families to celebrate the completion of one journey and the beginning of an even greater one. Please visit emory.edu/2020 to join in Commencement presentations and ceremonies, as well as to share messages with graduates. Commencement brings with it so many stories to celebrate, but also a wonderful reminder of why Emory exists – to support and educate exceptional scholars who, in turn, will help shape our communities, our world, our very future. And that is something to celebrate.

Sincerely, Claire E. Sterk, President Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

April 30, 2020 9:27 AM Emory Principles for Decision Making and Fall Planning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, At last week’s virtual town hall, we discussed some of the foundational principles that have helped shape the many decisions we’ve made in guiding Emory University through the new challenges of COVID-19. They affirm our commitments to compassion, honesty, respect and concern for the greater good, which are rooted within Emory’s long-standing values. The principles include: Emory will continue to vigorously pursue our mission to create, preserve, teach and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.

The health and safety of Emory’s students, faculty and staff is paramount in moving forward into recovery. We will make decisions based on the best medical, scientific and public health evidence and will be compliant with all federal, state and local laws and regulations and requirements of our accrediting bodies.

Emory will continue to provide excellent academic offerings, ensure student progress and protect our students’ ability to afford to attend Emory.

The ability of faculty, staff and students to conduct research and engage in scholarship will be fully supported. Interrupted and suspended activities will resume as soon as it is safe to do so.

Decisions will be reached in the context of shared governance and through processes that are transparent and collaborative. They will be supported by the best available data and draw upon the considerable expertise and intellectual capital of the university.

Decisions will allow for flexibility to respond to rapid and perhaps unanticipated changes in circumstances.

Financial well-being will be assessed with respect to the short-, medium- and long-term impacts on our community and Emory’s financial health.

Cost reductions through efficiencies and discretionary spending will be prioritized so as to minimize the impact on employment or compensation of our employees. If reductions affecting employment or compensation become necessary, they will be done in a fair and equitable manner that protects the most vulnerable (lowest paid) populations to the greatest extent possible.

We will communicate the basis and rationale for decisions to our community. While we have been called to make many decisions during this pandemic, one pending decision is the plan for reopening campus this fall. To that end, we assembled a Recovery Implementation Team that is using the principles above to outline solutions for a safe return to campus. This process includes a thoughtful review of important elements, including availability for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing procedures, isolation of COVID-19 positive individuals, plans to maximize social distancing and protection for the most vulnerable or for those who could be disproportionately impacted on campus. We will need to have procedures in place to continue physical distancing, oversee cleaning processes, establish universal face covering protocols and adhere to infection prevention strategies to maintain the health and safety of the Emory community. Our planning scenarios outline options for both in-person and remote learning modules as well as a combination of the two and are designed to dynamically adapt to public health guidelines and safety recommendations. However, there are still many variables to be considered for a fall reopening and many questions that need to be answered before we can release a definitive plan. We will communicate a decision and share what this means for the Emory community once important information is collected and analyzed, and a plan is developed for our community. While we thank you for your patience and understanding during this time, we also charge the entire Emory community — faculty, staff and students — to be imaginative and innovative as we work on creative and flexible solutions to meet our collective needs. It is certainly in Emory’s nature to be optimistic, and it is through interdisciplinary thought and courageous action that we can keep our community safe and healthy.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

April 29, 2020 9:44 AM Best Wishes for a Strong Finish Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, This week marks the beginning of final exams, a time that brings late nights and heightened stress as students and faculty conclude months of teaching and learning, preparing for next steps along the academic journey. Finals can be demanding in the best of times. But for everyone, this year has posed challenges unlike anything we’ve ever before experienced, as our spring semester was disrupted by a global pandemic. We want to acknowledge the remarkable resilience demonstrated by students, faculty and staff in adapting to significant changes, including an abrupt transition to online education. Our students had to adjust to a new way of learning in a very different environment. Faculty members swiftly pivoted to remote teaching, and across campus, staff members coordinated the technology and training needed to make it all work. Together, you’ve tackled these changes with creativity, talent and resolve. For that, we thank you. This is a very different kind of semester. Students may be feeling anxious about online tests or studying under stressful conditions at home without the convenience and reassurances of in-person study groups. They may be missing friends or finding it hard to concentrate and stay motivated. Meanwhile, faculty and staff are balancing their Emory-related responsibilities with additional demands at home as they care for family members and, in many cases, invest considerable time in their own children’s remote learning. We’re all juggling a lot and experiencing increased stress and anxiety. There are people and services here to help you make it through what has, for everyone, been an incredibly difficult time. If you are a student feeling stressed and unmotivated, please don’t hesitate to reach out to faculty members or academic advisors to answer questions, to better understand your academic support options. They understand the challenges you’ve had to face and are invested in seeing you succeed. For additional mental health and emotional support, a range of services are available to help with end-of-the-semester pressures, even if you are no longer on campus. Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) now offers telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. We’ve created opportunities for social connections, which can be accessed through the Emory Virtual Community Hub, and you can also find messages of encouragement and support and connect with student voices through Emory social media accounts. Support is available to faculty and staff through the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP), which offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. As the end of the semester quickly approaches, we want to extend our best wishes to all Emory students, faculty and staff for a safe and healthy conclusion to what has been an extraordinary year.

April 24, 2020 5:23 PM Town Hall Recap and link to video Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Earlier today, we hosted a virtual town hall — an opportunity to address the many questions that you may have as we developed new ways to learn and work together during a global pandemic. Our goal was to connect as a community and share information about Emory’s plan for the future, to shed light on our decision-making process and to hear your concerns. In order to give voice to as many individuals as possible and due to the large size of the webinar, questions were solicited in advance. If you contributed questions, thank you. They helped guide an important conversation that touched upon how we are supporting students with financial constraints and housing needs, financial impacts to the university, and questions about reopening campus. To find answers to questions that may not have been touched upon during the webinar, we encourage you to visit Emory’s COVID-19 website; you’ll find many of those questions are addressed on our FAQ page, which is regularly updated as new information emerges. If you were unable to attend the town hall, here is a link to the recording. If prompted, please enter your NetID and password. As the fluidity of this situation continues to develop and additional decisions are made, communication will remain crucial to sustaining a strong Emory community. We will continue to bring you up-to-date information about new decisions and developments through Emory Together emails. We’ll also invite your participation in additional town hall meetings. Thank you for being part of the conversation.

Sincerely, Claire E. Sterk, President Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

April 24, 2020 4:31 PM Emory Academic Continuity Planning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff --This message is sent on behalf of the leadership of Emory’s Academic Continuity Group, which is coordinating Emory’s response to COVID-19-- Dear Emory community, Without a doubt, this semester has provided lessons for all of us. Many of us have become newly acquainted with public health terminology, and extraordinary measures such as quarantine, stay-at-home orders, and physical distancing have clarified just how interconnected our lives — and our health — really are. Many of us have also experienced uncertainty the likes of which we might never have imagined. We all want to know how and when it will end, and we all want to bring a semblance of order, predictability and regularity to our lives. Since early February, the Office of the Provost, working with colleagues throughout the university, has been laser-focused on the spread of COVID-19, its impacts on our community, and the forms of support our students, faculty, and staff need as we do our part to respond and seek to flatten the curve. This required many decisions and rapid actions, including: Implementing remote learning for 4,239 classes taught by 1,662 professors;

Supporting thousands of employees in transitioning to remote working;

Developing a pandemic mitigation plan that resulted in ramping down and redirecting all but critical activities in our nearly $690 million research operation;

Recalling more than 150 undergraduate students from study abroad;

Helping 4,100 students move out of the residence halls;

Accommodating and relocating more than 300 students, including 49 from our Oxford campus, who were unable to return home before the end of the semester to the Clairmont campus;

Issuing student credits for housing, dining, and fees totaling nearly $14 million;

Providing students with lump sum payments of nearly $400,000 for federal work study, and paying non-federal work-study student employees $1,075,197 for anticipated on campus work contributions;

Providing $1.55 million in cash stipends to undergraduate students with the greatest financial need;

Disbursing $2.2 million to graduate and undergraduate students through the EmoryTogether fund, processing more than 6,000 requests for aid; and we expect to process another 1,000 applications for assistance;

fund, processing more than 6,000 requests for aid; and we expect to process another 1,000 applications for assistance; Creating a virtual community hub to pull together ways that students can connect online with old friends, make new friends and take care of themselves and others;

virtual community hub to pull together ways that students can connect online with old friends, make new friends and take care of themselves and others; Treating more than 700 student patients in student health services, and preparing a secondary facility in the event of a surge in illness;

Adapting grading policies for students, and extending the tenure clocks for faculty;

Combatting health stigmatization and racism by reaffirming and communicating our core values;

Aligning academic affairs, health sciences, and business administration to effectively manage our resources with the greatest of care so that we can be in the strongest possible position for the fall. Alongside all this activity, we have been planning for the future by drawing on the expertise of our world-renown and pioneering faculty in public health. We are assessing the capacities of our extraordinary health care system, learning from our peers, and consulting our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. The outstanding question on the minds of all of us at Emory is what will happen in the fall? We don’t have a decision for you just yet. However, we do want you to know that we are working on a plan for the coming academic year, and we thought you might appreciate more insight into the process and framework we’re using to reach decisions. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff is paramount. And we’ll settle for nothing less than excellence in the arenas of teaching and learning. Colleagues from across the university have been meeting in teams with leaders from each and every school and college, including Campus Life, Campus Services, Occupational Safety, Research Administration, Student Health, General Counsel, Communications and Public Affairs, Business Affairs, Enrollment Services, Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar’s Office, and Procurement to tackle problems and rapidly identify possible solutions. Together with CEPAR, we are drawing on all of these insights and operational expertise to develop a plan that will allow us to deliver on our academic mission, maintain standards, support path-breaking research, and advance the priorities of the university. All of us want to be together again to study and learn, explore and share just as soon as it safe for us to do so. We all want a return to life on campus, to classrooms and residence halls, libraries and labs, and clinical placements. When might we do so? How can we best support a healthy campus? These are among the many factors we are integrating in our planning. As we do this work, we’re inspired by the creativity, commitment, and resolve of our community. We will get through this together. Moreover, we are confident that — because of the efforts of so many — we are building an Emory that is even more capable and adaptive to change. That resilience will serve us well in both the short- and the long-term. Thank you for your patience as we explore what’s possible. Our resolve remains to “create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity.” And that mission matters now more than ever. Sincerely, Christa Acampora, Deputy Provost for Academic Affairs Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life Please visit the Academic Continuity page on Emory’s Coronavirus website for additional information.

April 21, 2020 10:32 AM Emory Town Hall | Friday, April 24 Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, As we enter our seventh week of remote learning and work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that you likely have many questions about how Emory is planning for the future and the basis for its decision making. While a video meeting certainly isn’t the same as coming together on campus face-to-face, we want to connect with you and address your questions via a virtual town hall meeting on Friday, April 24, 2020, from 2-3 p.m. EDT. Please note that while attendees are capped at 10,000 people, we will record the discussion and send any materials presented via email shortly after the meeting concludes to all students, faculty and staff. Questions for the town hall will be collected in advance to ensure that we can get to as many as possible. To submit a question for consideration, please visit this Google Form.

April 17, 2020 4:20 PM Commencement Update: Celebrating the Class of 2020 Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff --The following message was sent to Emory students who will be graduating in the spring of 2020-- Dear Emory Class of 2020, Emory’s Commencement ceremonies represent a soaring pinnacle of student achievement as our entire academic community comes together — along with beloved family and friends — to celebrate the culmination of your academic journey. We understand and share in your sense of loss not only for the formal Commencement festivities, but also for the very personal farewell and “thank you” moments with friends, faculty, mentors, and staff. While these in-person moments will have to wait for another day, we are eager to join your family and friends in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of your class in May. Over the past few weeks, a Commencement Task Force has gathered invaluable ideas and input from students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Students specifically — both undergraduate and graduate — were integral in guiding the final decisions and shared valuable feedback regarding key aspects of the traditional event they hold most dear. The goal was to create meaningful experiences that honor some of our beloved Commencement traditions and invite your voices to be part of the celebration in a way that can be preserved and cherished for years to come. In addition to the individual school events, a new interactive website will launch on May 4, to allow the entire community — family, friends, faculty members, staff, alumni and students — to honor graduates through uploaded messages, photos, and videos celebrating both your time within the Emory community and your induction as our newest alumni class. One website example is the “Y/our Moment,” a short film that helps tell the story of the Class of 2020 from your perspective and that of your faculty. These videos, along with many other ceremonial and celebratory pieces, will be featured on the website and shareable with your network of friends and family. We hope that you will take the time to engage in these interactive opportunities and add your personal thoughts and memories. Throughout the week of May 4, several other events will be featured on the site including Class Day and Baccalaureate presentations. Oxford College and several of Emory’s schools will host unique live and recorded award presentations and ceremonies, all leading up to the special events on May 11 when your degrees will be conferred (Oxford will be conferred on May 9). One special opportunity on that day will be an interactive address from our 2020 Commencement speaker, Bryan Stevenson, acclaimed human rights lawyer, activist, founder, and executive director of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative. Rest assured, Emory plans to invite graduates from the class of 2020 back to campus to gather, celebrate, and be recognized with family and friends. In today’s uncertain environment, we do not know the date that may be possible or exactly what the Commencement celebrations will look like —but we are committed to figuring out a path forward with you, Class of 2020. We know how important this is to so many of you and acknowledge the challenges that segments of the class may face in attending a future event on campus. The feedback of student representatives has been a critical part of the Commencement planning process and will remain so as we plan for these celebrations. In the meantime, we hope that these special Commencement activities, both university-wide and from your schools, will provide a real sense of completion and acknowledgement of a job well done under extraordinary circumstances. You’ve earned it, and we cannot wait to share in these experiences with you. We applaud your accomplishments, and look forward to joining you online soon, and in-person very soon.

Sincerely, Claire E. Sterk, President Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

April 16, 2020 10:18 AM Emory Student Organizations Provide Support Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, In our rapid transition to a new style of learning, teaching and working, many members of our community have helped ease the way for others. It’s within those moments that we find individuals who support the greater good. While examples of such service can be found in every corner of our campus and health care communities, we particularly want to acknowledge the creativity, patience and determination that have been demonstrated by our Emory students. Graduate and undergraduate students at Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have worked with other graduate and undergraduate students, staff, faculty and administrators to create new systems and portals and to identify resources that have helped make our new model work. Even amid the disruptions of packing to leave campus and adjust to remote learning, Emory students helped one another. During last month’s move-out, the Emory Student Government Association (SGA) quickly arranged free MARTA passes to help with transportation needs and collected and shared student concerns about remote learning. At the same time, the Emory College Council shifted to public online meetings and produced COVID-19-specific resources. The Emory Graduate Student Government Association (GSGA) has provided a range of resources, including sharing virtual fitness, health and wellness activities via social media; hosting a weekly online “Quarantine Quiz Show;” and facilitating discussions about ways to create and maintain a sense of community online. GSGA has maintained open lines of communication with each division to keep abreast of the remote student experience and related needs. The Oxford SGA also played a driving role in providing support and secured free boxes for students who returned to campus to pack up their rooms, while Oxford student residence life staff offered hands-on help to pack belongings for the transition to remote learning. Using social media, the Oxford SGA also launched a spotlight series to illustrate how students are managing the call for physical distancing. And as everyone has settled into a new online learning, graduate and undergraduate governance on both campuses opened new avenues for student involvement, moving governance meetings online, hosting virtual town halls and providing digital voting options for this month’s regularly scheduled elections. When students choose Emory, we know that they bring with them exceptional qualities, including leadership skills, creative minds, a desire to serve others, and an appreciation for the rewards that come from hard work. During these challenging times, it has been inspiring to see these skills applied to the larger good. From a grateful community, please know that your investments in supporting Emory are both acknowledged and deeply appreciated.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

April 14, 2020 10:30 AM Emory’s Virtual Community Hub Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Living through a global pandemic has driven home a truth that we’ve known all along: Emory is much more than a physical place. Whether you are on campus or a world away, we know that you carry with you the connections, the spirit and the values that, woven together, constitute the fibers of our cherished Emory bond. As we continue to adjust to the realities of remote learning, teaching and working, we want to make it easier for you to feel your connection to the Emory community. While we miss the ease of running into friends on the quad or attending our favorite club and athletic events, know that we are working on new ways to sustain a sense of community and stay connected. Student organizations, clubs and departments have created a growing selection of online meet-ups and virtual events that we hope you’ll explore and experience. Whether you’re used to meeting at the library for a study group, making new friends at the Emory Student Center or taking a break at the Michael C. Carlos Museum, please know that many Emory events and activities are available to you in new, online platforms. To make it easier to find the types of events and activities now available online—both familiar and exciting new opportunities—we have created the Emory Virtual Community Hub. This informational hub is designed for students to connect with friends and engage in Emory activities no matter where they may be. Here, you’ll find a place to connect, whether it’s joining the Buddhist Club for weekly meditation sessions or attending a virtual symposium or webinar. Explore how others are processing this unprecedented experience by visiting the Student Artist Virtual Gallery. There is even a place to record your own thoughts by writing a “Note to Self”—a reflection that will be kept in a “digital time capsule” and emailed back to you a year from now. To learn more, or to submit information about online events that you are organizing, we invite you to visit https://links.emory.edu/community. As we respond to the limitations of COVID-19 with new ideas and innovations, we invite you to join the conversation with your own creative suggestions. Together, let us face our shared challenges with community and connection.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life

April 10, 2020 5:02 PM Emory College Summer School Updates Emory College Students Dear student,

As you recently heard from the Provost’s office, courses will not be held on campus this summer. However, Emory College Online courses are still available, and most scheduled Emory College Summer School courses will be transitioning to the online format. You may view a list of all of the courses that will be transitioning to an online format, as well as all of the existing Emory College Online courses on the Summer Programs website.

The Course Atlas and OPUS will be updated over the coming week to reflect the shift of courses to the online format and to update each course with its new synchronous meeting times. Please be patient as we make these updates.

For those of you that were already enrolled in an on-campus Summer School course, you will remain enrolled as that course transitions to online. You will receive an email next week once all synchronous course times have been updated. At that point, we will encourage all enrolled students to check the required meeting times and decide if you would like to remain enrolled in the online version of the course. If you are no longer interested in being enrolled in a course as it transitions to an online format, you may drop the course via OPUS.

If your on-campus course is not transitioning to the online format, it will be cancelled, and you will receive an email notification to that effect. This will be rare, as most planned on-campus summer courses are transitioning to online.

Please note that all online summer courses will follow the Emory College Online format, which means that: All courses will include a combination of required synchronous sessions and asynchronous course content. Students are expected to attend the live synchronous sessions, just as they would be expected to attend classes on campus.

All students will need a webcam and a reliable internet connection in order to participate in their course. Please see the other technology requirements here

All regular Emory College academic policies (including add/drop/swap deadlines, S/U deadlines, Honor Code, etc.) apply to Emory College Online courses. Many online summer courses are at or near enrollment capacity. Please use the waitlist feature to indicate your intent to enroll in a course, even if it is full. The waitlists will be used to determine when additional sections of courses should be opened.

We are hopeful that those of you who desire to make academic progress this summer will be able to do so. Please email oue.advising@emory.edu to connect with an Academic Advisor or summerprograms@emory.edu with questions about summer online course offerings.

Sincerely, Emory College Summer Programs

April 10, 2020 1:19 PM Emory Summer Offerings Online and Fall Study Abroad Canceled Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, I have been so inspired by the creativity and commitment of our community as we have drawn together to meet the unprecedented challenges this semester presented. As we approach the end of the academic year, I wanted to provide you with updates on two important decisions so that you can plan accordingly for both summer and fall semesters. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff remain our top priority and guide our decision-making process. First, an update on summer academic programming at Emory : To protect public health and minimize risks for disruption, Emory University will offer only summer programming that can be completed off-campus and in remote learning formats. Information about online programming for the summer is available through your school registrar and on the Course Atlas website. Many of Emory’s summer offerings were specifically designed for online learning and are routinely offered in that format. If you were considering enrolling in summer courses, I encourage you to review these offerings, connect with your advisor if necessary, and complete your summer registration by the deadline established by your school or program. As previously announced, residential learning has been suspended for the remainder of the semester. Emory transitioned to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23. All university-sponsored events and gatherings of any size are indefinitely suspended. All university events and gatherings, both on and off campus, should shift to virtual venues or be postponed. If essential, brief meetings may be held in spaces large enough to accommodate appropriate social distancing. Also, Emory made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel Commencement exercises planned for May. We realize that this is enormously disappointing, but this was the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members in the face of the spread of COVID-19. Planning is already underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 later in the year, once we are able to do so safely. More information will be shared as these plans proceed. Second, an update on the status of undergraduate study abroad programs for fall 2020 : University-sponsored study abroad for undergraduate students in fall 2020 is canceled. We have made this difficult and disappointing decision based on the health and safety concerns associated with global and domestic travel and the uncertainty of conditions in various countries abroad. These considerations are also combined with concerns about the stability and resilience of the sponsoring organizations responsible for providing a quality experience that would allow students to achieve their academic and personal goals. For those of you who were planning on a study abroad experience this fall, I know this is difficult news to hear. While the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 makes planning for fall difficult, know that as we work to provide a year of rich learning experiences for students during the 2020-21 academic year, we will strive to create new and unique travel and study opportunities for students. I remain profoundly impressed by the resilience, patience and understanding shown by the Emory community as we all adjust to the many changes being forced upon us by COVID-19. I thank you all for your continued commitment to the life and work of the university, even at a distance, and wish you and your loved ones continued health and safety.

Sincerely, Jan Love Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs

April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S.

Honor Council Reminder The Emory College Honor Council would like to remind students that while you are completing coursework remotely, the Honor Code is still in effect. Be cautious as you interact and collaborate with others, or when you discuss or share your own work or the work of others. Please take a moment to review the Emory College Honor Code’s Appendix 3: Academic Misconduct in the Remote Learning Environment. Be mindful as you navigate remote teaching and learning as the new normal for the remainder of the semester. Most importantly, if you are in doubt about whether your actions may be problematic, you should contact your professor directly for clarification. Pre-Registration Pre-Registration continues this week for Emory College students. This week, students with 45+ earned hours will enroll. Please note that earned hours only includes courses that you have already completed. Hours that you are currently enrolled in this semester are NOT included in this count. In preparation for pre-registration we encourage you to: Review your enrollment times in OPUS Schedule an advising appointment with your major or pre-major faculty advisor. If you are not sure who your advisor is, their name and email address can be found in OPUS. Visit the University Course Atlas to explore courses for the Fall 2020 semester With pre-registration underway, here is part 2 of our Cool Courses feature. This feature is designed to highlight interesting opportunities, open to Emory College students, for credit. These are courses which typically have no pre-requisites. BUS 499: Design Thinking Do you want to learn a powerful approach for developing practical, creative solutions to real-world, messy, wicked problems? At its core, design thinking uses the mindset and methods of design practitioners to identify and address human needs by developing functional and emotionally meaningful products, services, processes, and spaces that address those needs. This highly experiential course, taught by Prof Jan Barton, is open to all Emory students, regardless of degree or major. Through short lectures and guided teamwork, you will learn a design thinking framework and a set of tools to help you navigate ambiguity, improve your ability to empathize with others, integrate diverse preferences and points of view, reframe challenges, ideate creative solutions, develop a “just-try-it” mindset for rapid experimentation, and enhance your presentation skills with storytelling and graphic design elements. You will showcase your learning in a final project addressing one of Emory’s current strategic challenges. REL 200R: LGBTQ Religion & Spirituality Rather than asking what religious traditions say about sexuality and gender, this course will focus on what LGBTQ-identified people have had to say about religion and spirituality, exploring their cultural agency and creativity. Here are a few examples of topics we will explore: the identification of the assassinated gay activist and politician, Harvey Milk, as "Saint Harvey Milk" by some LGBTQ people; lesbian feminist embodied goddess spirituality; the Radical Faeries movement; the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence order of "queer nuns"; the spiritual dimensions of Native American "Two-Spirit" identities; LGBTQ-affirming expressions of Pentecostal Christianity; LGBTQ atheism. The course will include site-visits, participant observation in cultural events, and guest speakers representing a variety of groups and communities.

April 6, 2020 10:54 AM Emory’s Commitment to Belonging Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Emory University’s motto — the wise heart seeks knowledge — underscores one of our key institutional principles: Our work here is driven by the heart. Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

April 3, 2020 4:30 PM Preventing Zoombombing Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Some Emory community members have reported incidents of “Zoombombing” where uninvited guests crash their Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars, and sometimes share upsetting or offensive content using the screen share option. Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.

In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.

In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.

While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.

The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.

April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option.

After April 27, students will have the option to submit a petition to request a change from a letter grade to S/U basis. Petition information will available on the Committee on Academic Standards website no later than April 24, 2020. Students must submit their petition for consideration by the following deadline: Graduating Seniors – May 11 All other students – May 18

Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3

Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu

Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education

March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A. Tedesco, Ph.D. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs – Graduate Studies Dean, James T. Laney School of Graduate Studies Professor, Rollins School of Public Health Emory University

March 30, 2020 10:03 AM Emory’s Commitment to Health and Safety Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared with community members while protecting patient privacy. As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

If you are having chest pain, serious difficulty breathing or any other type of medical emergency, call 911.

If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean’s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the Office of Injury Management (OIM) can help assess an employee’s readiness to return to work.

If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms. Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside. Social distancing is defined as remaining out of group settings, avoiding gatherings, and maintaining a 6 feet distance from others when possible per the CDC guidelines. Emory takes the health of our faculty, students, and staff very seriously and we are doing everything within our power to keep our community safe.

March 28, 2020 9:57 AM Welcoming Oxford to Atlanta Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Today, we welcome Oxford College students to Emory’s Atlanta campus to form a new community of more than 300 scholars actively engaging in remote learning while continuing to observe social distancing. To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.

Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

March 27, 2020 2:57 PM Emory Expands Support Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Throughout the unfolding challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve been proud of the many ways that Emory employees have rallied to support one another, working together as we adapt to a fast-changing landscape. From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each ne
