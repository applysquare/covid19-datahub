Most field trip and placement activity that has been cancelled will be assessed in an alternative way this academic year, via a method that requires desk-based research only – you will not be required to be on-site to undertake the learning/ assessment. 

The only exceptions to this will be in situations where your programme is accredited by a Professional Statutory or Regulatory Body (PSRB) and the learning outcomes cannot be replaced because they are required for PSRB accreditation – for example, clinical hours. Where this is the case, your School will keep you up to date as to the arrangements for allowing you to obtain the necessary experience and learning outcomes.
