Prospective Student: Academic Session 2020/21 Update

Communication sent to prospective students on Monday 1 June 2020.

I am delighted you are considering joining us at the University of Aberdeen, and I wanted to let you know that we are working extremely hard to get ready for your arrival and to support your learning experience with us.

We will be open and ready to welcome students to campus in September for the new session for blended learning - involving a mix of face-to-face teaching on campus, wherever that is possible and safe, as well as online learning where teaching cannot yet be in person.

Our on-campus activities will be available with appropriate distancing measures in place, and you will be able to take part in group teaching activities wherever possible. Practical work in labs or clinical teaching will still take place and you will be able to utilise study spaces around campus, again wherever possible while adhering to government guidelines.

There are some things of course that will not be possible while social distancing measures are still in place, such as large lectures or large group sessions. But you will not miss out on these experiences; instead these teaching and learning activities will be available online so that you can engage with all the learning that you need for your studies.

Your health, safety and wellbeing are our primary concern, and the University is planning all steps necessary to ensure the safety of our students and staff. This includes robust hygiene measures such as providing hand sanitiser at key locations, detailed guidance for students and staff on physical distancing, and measures to ensure that building occupancy levels adhere to national guidance.

Everyone - regardless of whether you are on campus or joining us virtually to begin with - will have access to the services you would expect such as the library, student support and the careers service. Our student accommodation is open and available, adapting to the changes required to keep you safe. We encourage you to apply for accommodation as usual – further information can be found here.

Depending on circumstances, financial assistance may also be available for students who are struggling as a result of the pandemic.

We know that Welcome Week and Orientation is an important part of your transition to University. Even though we can’t currently offer everything that we normally do, the University and the Aberdeen University Students’ Association are planning a range of exciting opportunities for you whether you are campus-based or joining us online initially. More information on these arrangements will follow.

In the meantime, we are here to support you. We will continue to update coronavirus web pages with the latest information, and we will keep in touch as our preparations continue, so that you are kept up to date with all the details you will need to join us.

We hope this email will have answered some of your questions, but if you have any further questions that haven’t been answered, please do feel free to email study@abdn.ac.uk.

Finally, let me assure you that by choosing the University of Aberdeen you are joining a distinguished and innovative institution with a history dating back 525 years, and our sense of community as we tackle challenges together has never been stronger.

We hope that you choose to study with us, and we will be here, ready to welcome you to our beautiful campuses, when you are ready to join us.

Until then, I hope that you and your families and friends all stay safe and well.

George
