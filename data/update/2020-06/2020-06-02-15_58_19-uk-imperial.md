Research pilots  |   
---  
Our pilot research groups are learning the best ways to restart our most laboratory intensive research on campus. Professor Ricardo Martinez-Botas, from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, said: "Researchers have been present this week in the Turbo Lab, with a maximum of two people present at a time. It has been possible for one person to carry out most work, with their office-based buddy performing regular checks and providing hands-on support only when necessary.” You can find out more of about the pilots and the reflections of those taking part on our [restarting research webpage](https://commsandpublicaffairsall.newsweaver.com/9toyphkuvf/16ppggq914h4h632plsmec/external?a=5&p;=4710054&t;=3152837). We will update you again soon with our plans for the next phase of our restart. Until then please continue to work from home unless you have heard from your Head of Department directly.

[The findings](https://commsandpublicaffairsall.newsweaver.com/9toyphkuvf/sn2gsebah3b4h632plsmec/external?a=5&p;=4710054&t;=3152837) highlight the need for additional measures to be in place as lockdown restrictions are eased.

The reusable personal protective equipment, known as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), is a personal respirator that filters the air, to remove hazardous fine particles, such as those from COVID-19.
