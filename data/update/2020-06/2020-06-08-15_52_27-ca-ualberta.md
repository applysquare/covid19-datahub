Here are this week’s updates for the U of A community:

COVID-19 Information for Graduate Students

The Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research has created a comprehensive online space for graduate students to learn more about how the realities of the evolving COVID-19 response may impact them. The page includes information related to learning, supervision, examinations, convocation, finances & program requirements, and research.

Alberta’s Relaunch Guide for post-secondaries

The Government of Alberta has shared a relaunch guide for post-secondary institutions. The U of A planning and operating efforts will follow the advice offered in the document, including the recommendation “to continue to hold classes remotely and limit in-person attendance on campus as much as possible.”

Alberta’s State of Emergency & the campus impact

Yesterday, the Premier noted plans to lift the State of Emergency in Alberta on June 15. This date will not impact our campuses. As the Government of Alberta has outlined in their relaunch information and planning, various public health restrictions will remain for our community and across Alberta for some time yet. Expected restrictions, such as physical distancing and non-essential travel in particular, will continue to impact our community.
