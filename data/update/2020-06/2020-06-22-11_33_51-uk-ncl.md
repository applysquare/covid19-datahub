Dear Students,

Friday 12 June is, officially, the end of term for undergraduate students. In normal circumstances you would all be looking forward to a long summer vacation full of activities, travel or work. Finalists would be deciding whether to continue their studies, enter the world of work or take a well-deserved break. But, as we are all well aware, these are not normal circumstances and this year’s vacation period will be very different.

The finalists among you may be thinking about how your hard work will be recognised and how you can say ‘goodbye’ and stay in touch with the friends and colleagues who have supported you during the last few years. You will hear from me again next week with a reminder of the support that is available to you from our Careers Service, and how we can keep in touch with you about our plans for an on campus, face to face, graduation ceremony.

Those of you who will be returning in September may be wondering when campus activities will resume, how teaching will be delivered safely and when facilities such as the libraries, computing clusters and sport centre will reopen.

I’d like to assure you that we are working on all of these areas in partnership with NUSU and, over the coming weeks and months, we will be answering your questions. Starting next week and throughout the vacation period, I will be sending fortnightly messages to continuing students with updates on our preparations for reopening the campus and for the resumption of teaching on 19 October 2020, so please check your emails regularly.

Keeping you safe in Newcastle

Now that lockdown rules have been relaxed a little, if you are planning to return to Newcastle to collect your belongings, please be mindful of the Government’s guidelines on social distancing, to help control the spread of the Coronavirus.

These latest social distancing guidelines state that you must not:

gather outdoors in groups of more than six people with people you do not live with or, from 13 June, people that are not in your support bubble

visit friends or family inside their home or any other indoor place, except for the limited set of circumstances set out in law or if they are in your support bubble

stay away from your home or your support bubble household overnight - including holidays - except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes

While back in Newcastle, please also be aware of the fact that many of our local residents are elderly and/or have been shielding. Most are also exercising social distancing guidelines. At this very difficult time, it is not surprising that sensitivities are heightened and so please do your bit to make sure we all stay safe.

I’d like to thank those students who have worked to support their local communities during the lockdown as actions like these do a lot to enhance our relationships with local residents.

Finally, we are aware that some of you may be planning to take part in one of the many events that have been organised around the country, including Newcastle, for people to express their views about the death of George Floyd and racial discrimination.

These are planned to take place during the day on Saturday and as a result, Newcastle will be busier than usual, so anyone in the city will need to be extra vigilant and take extra care to keep themselves safe. Remember to download the SafeZone app which is free for all students and staff and connects you directly to the University security team when you need help while you are on campus.

Useful information and contact numbers can also be found on our Staff and Student Wellbeing pages.

We will continue to update our FAQs over the next few weeks and if you have any questions that are not answered there, please contact us via Covid19enquiries@ncl.ac.uk.
