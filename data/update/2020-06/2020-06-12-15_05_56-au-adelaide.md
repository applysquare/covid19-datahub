The University understands that some students cannot or will not want to want to attend face-to-face teaching components in Semester 1, Trimester 2 or Term 2 owing to their physical location (overseas, interstate or regional) or individual health concerns. Each course that offers a face-to-face component will have alternative arrangements in place for these students.
