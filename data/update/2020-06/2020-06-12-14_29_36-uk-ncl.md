Please see the update message from the Newcastle University Academic Registrar below. Can I also remind you that if you have any queries or concerns, please contact us at AskNUL@ncl.ac.uk

Dear Newcastle University London Doctoral Students,

I hope you are well.

In this week’s update I provide you with information on our plans for returning to campus. I also highlight a survey that NUSU are conducting on the move to the remote delivery which I’d be grateful if you could complete. You can find further details and a link to the survey below.

Finally, I include an important reminder of mental health support services that are available to postgraduate students, the latest update from the Home Office (UKVI) for international students, and details of some forthcoming NUSU events for you to look forward to.

Plans for returning to campus - Newcastle University London campus

Please note that it has not yet been decided whether it will be possible to return to the London campus in Semester one. A process is taking place to assess the Middlesex Street building in view of the comprehensive safety measures which the University will require to ensure student and staff safety (aligned with those on the Newcastle University campus). This assessment will also include consideration of specific London location issues such as transport and travel.

Plans for returning to campus - Newcastle University campus

As you will know the government has started the process of bringing the country out of lockdown and we know that you will be keen to be kept up to date on plans to re-open campus and what this means for the University and your study arrangements.



We are considering how life on campus might work in the months to come and are already working hard to look at the practical, physical and wellbeing implications of our transition back to campus. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion are being considered alongside all these requirements.



Please be assured that whatever the Government plan is we cannot expect our return to campus to be quick, nor will it be a case of everyone returning together. We are planning for a campus where we can all feel safe, that includes physical distancing and that follows health and safety advice. To get this right will necessarily be a gradual process.



Any return to campus will be phased, starting with the identification of priority buildings for re-opening. Entry into these building again will be phased, starting with service staff to make the building ready for use, followed then by access for researchers and research students (Doctoral and MPhil) on a priority basis. Access priorities will be evaluated on a case by case basis, however, we wanted to reassure you that Doctoral and MPhil students are an important consideration when determining these.



We will update you when further information is available, but it is likely that your supervisor will be a crucial source of information for you about any return to campus.



Access to the library

We appreciate the importance of library resources and services to the furtherance of your studies. Whilst the closure of the physical libraries has inevitably restricted access to print material, we hope that you are able to maximise your use of our extensive e-resources. There are over half a million e-books and 50,000 journals already available with more being added all the time. If you would like to recommend new books or other resources in your area of interest we will do our best to acquire them for you, but for the moment, we are only sourcing electronic versions rather than print.



Our general library help service is available 24/7 and you can book one to one appointments with a Liaison Librarian for a customised online chat about your information needs.

More information on all library resources and service can be found on the University Library webpages.



Student survey

You will have recently received an email asking you to participate in a University survey. This survey is being run by a team representing Newcastle University Students’ Union (NUSU), the University’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) team and Inclusive Newcastle. The survey will help us to understand the impact of the University’s move to remote delivery and to enhance your online learning experience. We would very much value your participation in this survey which should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Home Office (UKVI) guidance

In response to the current Coronavirus pandemic, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) has updated its guidance on alternative arrangements for those who require immigration permission to remain in the UK. The guidance, which you should read in full, is available on the Gov.UK website.



The key update relates to visas with expiry dates that fall between 24th January and 31st July 2020.



If your visa expires between these dates and you cannot leave the UK because of travel restrictions or self-isolation related to COVID-19, your visa will be extended to 31st July 2020.



Please note that you must request for an extension by updating your records with the Coronavirus Immigration Team (CIT) using their online form.



UKVI will let you know when your request is received, and when your visa has been extended.

If you have previously had your visa extended to the 31st May 2020, your visa will be extended automatically to the 31st July 2020. You do not need to complete the online form.



If you are still a registered student at Newcastle University, please let us know that your visa has been extended by sending your confirmation to visa.nul@ncl.ac.uk
