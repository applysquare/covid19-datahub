All students due to graduate this July should have received an email about an online ‘celebration event’ taking place on Friday, 17 July 2020.

At this virtual event students will receive their degree ‘in absentia’, and a special film will be shown with highlights of the Class of 2020’s time in Liverpool.

Joining instructions for the online event will be emailed to all graduating students nearer the time.
