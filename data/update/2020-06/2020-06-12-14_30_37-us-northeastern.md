*Published on June 5, 2020*

To all members of the Northeastern University community:

On June 1, Northeastern University started a phased reopening of research labs and administrative offices with a small number of faculty and staff returning to our campuses. As we have discussed before, following President Aoun’s May 8th message, the university’s intent is to reopen our campuses this fall, including on-site instruction and with a residential experience for our students—while maintaining a healthy and safe environment for our community. We have been planning innovatively—informed by public health guidelines—for reducing density on our campuses, including in residence halls and in classrooms.

Today, we are announcing NUflex, an exciting hybrid-flexible learning experience available for Northeastern classes this fall. NUflex will provide a learning experience that is personalized for each student’s needs, whether they are on campus or joining the class from a remote location.

NUflex classes will meet in a physical location at a scheduled class time. Some students may attend class in person while others will be connected virtually through innovative technology that allows for communication by audio, chat, or video. This synchronous delivery will allow remote students to see and hear the instructor, interact in real-time with the instructor and their classmates, and access the teaching tools—such as a whiteboard or projection screen—that the faculty member is using in the classroom. In addition, NUflex classes will be recorded and available for students to watch on their own schedule.

This flexible learning model will provide students at any location with the ability to reduce their time in the classroom, to begin the academic term remotely, or to return home to complete courses remotely before the end of the academic term. Northeastern has invested in state-of-the-art classroom technology and in enhanced faculty training to support the highest quality learning experience for students. A Northeastern team is currently outfitting classrooms across our campuses to be ready for the fall. The fall term will follow the planned academic calendar, with classes starting on September 9 for undergraduate students and ending December 9.

In the weeks ahead, we will be providing updates on housing and dining density control plans, testing and tracing operations, travel guidance, and safety protocols. As always, we encourage you to check the university’s COVID-19 website frequently for the latest information.

With the health and safety of our community as our first concern, we have developed a plan for learning that is uniquely Northeastern—powered by innovative research, by boundary-crossing networks, and by learning that empowers lifelong learners to reshape our human communities.

Sincerely,

Kenneth W. Henderson
