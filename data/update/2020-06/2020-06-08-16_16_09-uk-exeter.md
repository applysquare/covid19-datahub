We are committed to doing everything possible to enable us to welcome new and returning students to the University campuses for the start of the autumn term.

As long as it is safe to do so, we will keep our campuses open and we will seek to enable social interaction, access to facilities and face to face teaching.

Nevertheless, we must be realistic because we expect that social distancing and other restrictions are likely to continue for many months and the situation and government guidance that we must follow may change very rapidly at times during the year ahead.

In **learning and teaching** , we are planning for flexibility and for resilience in our approach so that whatever the year throws at us we will be providing you with the best possible opportunity to learn, to progress on your degree programme and to succeed.

All of our departments will deliver their portfolio of programmes flexibly â€“ whether fully online, on-campus where possible, or a mix of the two through blended learning. This also means delivering programmes in an accessible manner, with the ability to switch smoothly between delivery modes as circumstances dictate.
