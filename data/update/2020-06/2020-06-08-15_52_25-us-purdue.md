Creating a memorable experience during a difficult time, Purdue University in August will stage its second on-demand commencement ceremony in four months.

About 1,000 summer graduates are expected to hear their names called, watch the keynote speaker deliver words of encouragement and hear the traditional Purdue celebratory commencement music. For health and safety reasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it will not be in person.

During a special meeting on May 26, Purdue’s Board of Trustees determined that the August commencement ceremony will be conducted in a manner consistent with the method successfully used for the May 2020 commencement.

Purdue’s spring Class of 2020, which numbered about 7,500 graduates, was able to experience the joys of their accomplishment and share it with their loved ones through a special on-demand “commencement in a box.”

Sent to graduates hailing from Indiana to India, the box included a diploma cover, commencement program, any earned honors cords and medals, and some Boilermaker goodies. The box also contained information on how to download their own ceremony so the students could watch with their families at a time that worked for them. Diplomas were mailed to the graduates.

The same approach is planned for Purdue’s August commencement, but details are still being worked out, said Chris Pass, senior assistant registrar for academic records, commencement and graduation.

More information will be shared with graduates in the coming weeks.
