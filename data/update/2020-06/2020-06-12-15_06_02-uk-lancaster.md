We have taken the difficult decision to postpone summer Graduation ceremonies, due to take place between Tuesday 14th July and Friday 17th July 2020, to December 2020. We have [prepared FAQs](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/graduation/graduation-covid-19) where you will find answers to many of your questions about this postponement. We will provide more information as and when it is available.
