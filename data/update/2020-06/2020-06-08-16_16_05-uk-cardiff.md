We are working with our academic schools and support services to consider the feasibility of study trips, years abroad and work placements in response to the government guidelines in place across the UK and internationally.

Where these activities cannot be delivered or there are changes to delivery we will be open and honest with you, and share information with you as soon as we have it.
