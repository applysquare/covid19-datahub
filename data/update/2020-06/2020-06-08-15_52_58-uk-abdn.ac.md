Current Student: Academic Session 2020/21 Update

Communication sent to current students on Monday 1 June 2020

We hope you are staying well amid these difficult times. The pandemic has been tough on everyone and of course has had an impact on your time with us so far.

Many of you will now have completed your assessments for this academic year. Well done on getting this far – it really is an achievement. Some of you may still have some assessments outstanding, and your Schools will continue to provide advice and guidance as necessary to support you.

As your thoughts turn to the next academic year, we want to provide you with information about what your return to study will entail. If you are one of our students in Qatar, you will hear separately about plans for the new academic year.

Most importantly, we want to reassure you that we will be open and ready for your return to studies in September. We very much hope that you are able to make arrangements to rejoin us on campus. We look forward to seeing you back with us for blended learning - a mix of face-to-face teaching, where safe and possible, and online learning where teaching cannot yet be in person.

The University is planning extensively for a return to our campuses and taking all steps necessary to ensure the safety of students and staff. This includes robust hygiene measures such as providing hand sanitiser at key locations, detailed guidance for students and staff on physical distancing, and measures to ensure that building occupancy levels adhere to national guidance.

Our on-campus activities will be available with appropriate distancing measures in place, and you will be able to take part in group teaching activities wherever possible. Practical work in labs or clinical teaching will still take place and you will be able to utilise study spaces around campus, again wherever possible while adhering to government guidelines.

There are some things of course that will not be possible while social distancing measures are still in place, such as large lectures or large group sessions. But you will not miss out on these experiences; instead these teaching and learning activities will be available online so that you can engage with all the learning that you need for your studies.

Everyone, regardless of whether you are on campus or joining us virtually, will have access to the services you would expect such as the library and the careers service.

There may be special arrangements for you if you have, for example, a placement or fieldwork as part of your programme. In these cases, your School will be in touch with you directly.

Depending on circumstances financial assistance may also be available for students who are struggling as a result of the pandemic.

The University and the Aberdeen University Students’ Association will continue to offer a range of activities and support for all students whether you are campus-based or joining online initially, with more details around these to follow.

Our student accommodation is open and available, adapting to the changes required to keep you safe. We encourage you to apply for accommodation as usual – further information can be found here: https://www.abdn.ac.uk/accommodation/

We hope this email will have answered some of your questions. The University also continues to update its coronavirus web pages with the latest information, but if you have any further questions that haven’t been answered, please do feel free to email coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

We are very much looking forward to welcoming you back to your university for the new academic year. We will stay in touch and provide more detail about what you can expect from your experience as well as offer you all the information and support you will need so that you are ready for blended learning. We are excited about the future and see the challenges of this situation as ones which will help us grow together as a community.

Best wishes
