An important part of university life is the student experience. To help you succeed while studying online, student support services are also transitioning to support social distancing measures.

Many of these support options will use phone calls or video conferencing tool [Zoom](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/using-uts-systems/zoom) to connect with you.

### Academic support

[HELPS academic support](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps) programs are now available via Zoom. You can:

  * chat about your assignment with a HELPS advisor  
  * book a one-to-one consultation to get feedback about your assignment draft  
  * attend a workshop to develop your academic skills (see the [workshop schedule](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/daily-workshops))



[U:PASS student learning program](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass/upass) will be online for most subjects. 

English speaking programs will be available online via Zoom, including:

  * one-to-one sessions with the [Buddy Program](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/helps-uconnect) (you can also support international students, make friends and gain volunteering hours by [volunteering to be a Buddy](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/helps-uconnect))  
  * [group conversation sessions](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/english-speaking) starting 24 March.

  * [virtual internships](https://www.insidesherpa.com/)



Face-to-face services are transitioning to support social distancing soon (more details to come).  

### Financial assistance

[Financial Assistance Services](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/financial-help/financial-assistance-service) can help you over the phone or via Zoom with:

  * budgeting
  * financial coaching and
  * financial referrals.   



### Accessibility assistance

[Accessibility Service](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service) can help you over the phone or via Zoom with confidential consultation around:  

  * providing accessible learning environment to maximise participation and minimise impact of disability or health conditions on your studies,  
  * services to assist with access, including individual and general access supports  
  * individual needs for assessment accommodations and adjustments and facilitate requests via the Faculty Academic Liaison Officer.  



### Accommodation and housing support

**If you need to cancel your non-UTS accommodation** contract due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and need assistance, contact the UTS Student Legal Service at [studentlegalservice@uts.edu.au](mailto:studentlegalservice@uts.edu.au).  Please provide them with your name, UTS ID, the reason why you need to cancel your accommodation and what you need assistance with. 

**If you need help finding accommodation** , look at the [short-term off-campus options on the UTS Housing website](mailto:https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/uts-housing-service/uts-housing-services/off-campus-accommodation), or email [housing.welfare@uts.edu.au](mailto:housing.welfare@uts.edu.au). 

### Further support

We are working on further flexible options which may include: 

  * some subjects offered as intensive blocks once you arrive, starting from around Stuvac (Week 7) but potentially up to the end of Winter session (July 2020) if delays persist 
  * deferral at no cost 
  * option to change your enrolment to replace one of two of your subjects with an elective that is available fully online 
  * additional subjects offered in Winter and Spring sessions to allow students to catch up on load 
  * certain subjects offered wholly online 
  * withdrawing from subjects â€” students affected by travel restrictions will be permitted to withdraw from subjects after the census date without penalty.
