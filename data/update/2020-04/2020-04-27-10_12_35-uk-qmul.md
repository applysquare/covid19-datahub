We are preparing to welcome new students to our campuses in September 2020. However, if you are unable to take your place this year, you may be able to defer entry until September 2021.

To hold a deferred place, you would normally need to achieve the full conditions of your offer. In addition, your deferral would need to be authorised by your academic department. We cannot guarantee that all deferral requests are approved. Where a deferral is approved, applicants are not normally permitted to defer more than once and for more than one academic year.

If you like to discuss deferring your place, please contact the Admissions team by email or through the applicant portal.
