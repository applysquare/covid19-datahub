  * Commencing students may choose to defer until Term 2.  
  * The student visa will stay in place. However, the deferral process (for commencing students) results in the cancelling of the current Certificate of Enrolment (COE). A new offer from the university must be accepted before a new COE is processed.  
  * Students need both a valid COE and visa to enter Australia  
  * We advise students to check the [Visa Entitlement Verification Online(link is external)](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/already-have-a-visa/check-visa-details-and-conditions/check-conditions-online) (VEVO) system for updated visa details and conditions.
