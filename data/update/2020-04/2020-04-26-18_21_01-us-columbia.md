Along with generous donor support, we are directing University resources to support a fund for PhD summer 2020 stipend enhancements of up to $3,000 per student depending on certain factors, such as whether students have opportunities at the University for summer employment. This will be made available to over 1,000 doctoral students whose schools typically appoint them on a nine-month basis. These funds are available to assist with a range of challenges and contingencies that our students are facing during the COVID-19 emergency.

$1,500 will be distributed to all eligible students before June 1; no application is required. Students may apply for a second disbursement of $1,500 if they do not have summer employment at the University. Application instructions will be forthcoming from the schools. The second disbursement will be paid by the end of July.
