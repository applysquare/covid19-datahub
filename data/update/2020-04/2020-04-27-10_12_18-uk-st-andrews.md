For the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, viva examinations are to be conducted online. Internal examiner, candidate and external examiner will be connected from different places. All other University policies, in particular those on good academic practice and the conduct of viva examinations, remain unaffected.

In some cases, it may be more appropriate for a viva to be postponed. If you have any questions about whether your viva should go ahead, please speak to your internal examiner in the first instance. If necessary, they can speak to the PGR Pro Dean about the possibility of postponing the viva.
