Unfortunately, we have taken the difficult decision to postpone the summer graduation ceremonies (Summer 2020).

We will support you in receiving your formal qualification at the normal time in order to progress academically or into your future career and we will offer an alternative form of celebration of your achievement at a later date.

We know this will be disappointing but need to take all necessary measures to protect the health of our staff and student community.
