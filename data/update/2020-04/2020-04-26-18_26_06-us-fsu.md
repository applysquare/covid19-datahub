This message to all faculty, staff and students has been approved by Dr. Sally McRorie, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.

FSU is extending course registration for Summer and Fall 2020. Registration is open through the end of Finals Week (11:59 p.m. ET Friday, May 1). Students have an extra week to design their ideal course schedules.

All Summer 2020 classes will be offered online or through remote instruction. Options to study away from campus will be more flexible than ever in Summer 2020.

Students should contact their academic advisors with questions about building their Summer and Fall schedules.
