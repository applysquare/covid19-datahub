  * Face-to-face teaching may still be suspended at the start of Term 2, and so we plan to offer all classes online. If you commence a course online you will be able to complete the course online. 


  * If you return to your home country, this means you do not have to return to Australia to start/complete your Term 2 course. You can simply do your course online.  


  * Given these special circumstances, we plan to only offer courses in Term 2 that can be successfully completed online. Therefore, some courses will no longer be available.  


  * Your COE will remain active which means that there will be no change to your student visa. As long as you have an active COE there will be no impact on your visa. You can come back to Australia as long as it is before your visa end date.  


  * If you want to go home we recommend you tell your course convenor so that they know where you are, but this is not essential.
