April 15, 2020 Changes to Summer Sessions I and II: Catch-Up, Make-Up, and Level-Up Due to worldwide distancing measures and travel restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, LMU will conduct its 2020 summer sessions solely online. The deans’ offices in LMU’s schools and colleges are working with faculty to determine which summer courses, originally scheduled before the pandemic, will still be offered. Schools and colleges are also determining new courses that will be offered in service of the following themes: Catch-Up: Students who withdrew from or failed courses required to complete a degree requirement will have the opportunity to retake them or take other courses that fulfill requirements;

Students who withdrew from or failed courses required to complete a degree requirement will have the opportunity to retake them or take other courses that fulfill requirements; Make-Up: Students who were unable to enroll in or complete courses due to COVID-19 will have the opportunity to do so;

Students who were unable to enroll in or complete courses due to COVID-19 will have the opportunity to do so; Level-Up: Students whose original summer plans have changed can get ahead in their degree or earn additional credits towards graduation.

Additionally, a special Summer 2020 Financial Aid Program has been established, and undergraduate students who enroll in at least 6 credit hours will be eligible to apply by completing the online application . Summer course information will be posted on PROWL beginning this week. In the meantime, please refer to these FAQs for additional guidance. Summer Housing 2020 The Student Housing Office is committed to offering summer housing to all students who were approved to remain in university-owned and operated housing after March 22, 2020. Information about summer housing rates and the application process will be made available to these residents on April 16. The deadline to complete applications is April 24. Those residents who do not apply for summer housing and who will be moving out at the end of the spring term will be sent information about the move-out process. The university is unable to offer summer housing to additional students while the city of Los Angeles and the state of California Safer at Home orders remain in place. Should these orders be altered or lifted, the university will evaluate the feasibility to offer housing to students enrolled in LMU summer courses, participating in registered internships and/or those approved to work 20 or more hours per week on campus.

Please contact the Student Housing Office at housing@lmu.edu or 310.338.2963 if you have any further questions.

In one summer, participants can cover several courses of U.S. income tax law using hands-on approaches, live discussions led by leading tax faculty and engaging material. Twelve units of credit may be applied to LLS’ Master of Tax Law (MT) program, which is intended to allow accounting students to satisfy California’s “fifth year” requirements for CPA licensure.
