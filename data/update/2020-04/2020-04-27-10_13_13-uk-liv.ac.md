Given the exceptional set of circumstances in which we find ourselves, with your academics also affected by COVID-19 and the lockdown, unfortunately it has been necessary to take the decision to delay the publication of **some** exam results. We will prioritise grades for final year students (including those of you progressing on to an integrated Masters with us), as we know this is particularly important for your onward progression and therefore, if you are in your final year, you will receive your results on Wednesday, 15 July.

All continuing students will now receive their results a week later, on Thursday, 23 July.
