Many unknowns still exist globally and locally when it comes to COVID-19 and what lies ahead. While public health authorities have not indicated any definitive timelines for current prevention measures and restrictions affecting our community, university planners can still plan ahead with flexibility using the informed advice of public health, pandemic, and emergency management experts.

The University of Alberta has established a Fall 2020 Planning Group of a steering committee and six sub-groups to oversee planning for the Fall 2020 Academic Term. Their planning activities will be guided by a set of principles, three main and adaptable scenarios according to the various prevention measures and restrictions, and three key goals:

To provide the best possible learning experience for our students.

To maximize research activities throughout the pandemic.

To continue to use this period to propel innovation, efficiency, and relevance in our research, our work, and our classrooms as a leading global research university.

See the University of Alberta Fall Semester Scenario Planning document for additional details.

The vision, principles, planning assumptions and three adaptable planning scenarios of the Fall 2020 Planning Group were approved by the President’s Executive Committee on April 16 and presented to the General Faculties Council on April 20.

Purpose

The Fall 2020 Planning Group will develop a unified plan according to three guiding scenarios to address all functions and operations necessary for the university to fulfil its mission as of the Fall 2020 Academic Term.

Next Steps

April - May: Planning and consultation

June: University leadership review and governance approval of Fall 2020 unified plan

July: Implementation begins based on preventative measures as of July 1, 2020
