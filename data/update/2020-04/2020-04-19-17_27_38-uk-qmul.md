Many thanks for working so hard to migrate educational content on to QMPlus at such short notice.  If you are planning to hold "live" interactive events in real time (e.g. webinars), please can you try to schedule these for the time at which scheduling had already been planned for your module.  This should minimise the risk of session clashes where your students are required to be online for more than one module at the same time.  It should also help to even out the demand on the QMPlus server (hosted externally) if thousands of students are required to log on at the same time and so should reduce the risk of the VLE becoming unstable and crashing.  Your collegiality and assistance in helping to try and best support ongoing education in these challenging times is very much appreciated.
