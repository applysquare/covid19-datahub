International student email

 **Support update for International Students**

Dear student

We hope you are keeping safe and well.

We wanted to write to you with a couple of updates in response to questions we have received from our international student community.

### 

Government letter to international students

In case you missed this in the email from the Vice Chancellor earlier this week, the UK Government Universities Minister has recently[ issued a letter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirus.york.ac.uk%2Fupdate-messages-and-emails%2Fthursday-9-april-letter-from-minister-donelan-to-international-students&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHhQxrH1A-0P3GlMWM7sG0HQ-3APQ) to international students which provides tailored guidance and advice, both for international students studying now, but also details about visas and studying here in the UK from Autumn 2020 to provide reassurance during this difficult time. 

### 

Visas

In relation to studying remotely, whether from the UK or your home country, your Tier 4 status and visa expiry date will remain unaffected. Remember the International Student Support Team are online. You can call, email or make an appointment with one of our advisors, for assistance with queries including immigration and travel plans. Please see [www.york.ac.uk/internationalsupport](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Finternationalsupport&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEkIBsp7t7heycd3t-j0YUy0ybirA) for contact details.

### 

Accessing your University email

We continue to recommend the use of @[york.ac.uk](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fyork.ac.uk%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGfOs1wCrTGYnHIPG0q6MFx2GfZdQ) e-mail addresses, wherever possible. Students are encouraged to set a forwarding address if they are unable to access Google Mail. Google Mail is sometimes blocked, for example, in China. Affected students will need to ensure they have a forwarding address set so that they continue to receive important University correspondence.

If you have difficulties doing this you can contact [itsupport@york.ac.uk](mailto:itsupport@york.ac.uk) who can set your account up to forward on your behalf. Alternatively, you can use the University of York’s [VPN ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fit-services%2Fservices%2Fvpn%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEqYG5UcOuUzoDyRtSiz0VANLWLnA)or [Virtual Desktop Service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fit-services%2Fservices%2Fvds%2Fvirtual-desktop%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHKupFOP7QLVmpn9lZsUhwsr4oUFQ) (VDS) to set up a forward. 

### 

Support for you

Please remember wherever you are in the world we are still here to support you. We are continually developing and posting new information on the[ Covid-19 website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirus.york.ac.uk%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG4TurrmifgQJhOjMqLFqWvdevkZw). We have set up a dedicated call centre for any questions you have as the term progresses which you can reach on +44 (0)1904 809571.

For students who may be suffering financial difficulties we have relaunched the [emergency support fund](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fyork-unlimited%2Four-priorities%2Fstudent-to-shine%2Femergency-student-support-fund%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHnuK-26pEqCv2Z77sjAGG302inKw), and you can also find information on other sources of [financial support](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fstudents%2Ffinance%2Fhardship%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF60iKuIEL_RXAMs9AkezsYw7Sz0g) on the student support pages. If you are concerned about your funding please contact the [Student Hub](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fstudents%2Fsupport%2Fstudent-hub%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHijoCzBSffP2rEQXfg44sJm-IBTQ). 

We also have updated [wellbeing ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fstudents%2Fhealth%2Fadvice%2Fcoronavirus%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGc59W4O1elzaPnVvQsNwuefQ1EZA)pages and [top tips](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.york.ac.uk%2Fstudents%2Fhealth%2Fwellbeing%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGjx0xRQ421dkGUCEObeIMWtxpCyw) for your wellbeing during these difficult times. We are also asking students to tell us where they are currently living so that we understand where you are and offer the right levels of support to you. If your circumstances have changed, or you have not yet told us where you’ll be for the Summer term, please log into [e:vision ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsrvgate.york.ac.uk%2Fevision%3Fdl%3Dsl_plans&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHBumvw3i4HRRasK8QWZDhhIhE_tQ)as soon as possible and provide us with information on your current location. Please also make sure to update your current term time address if this has changed.

Please take care and we wish you well with your studies over the coming months

Kind regards

The International Support Team
