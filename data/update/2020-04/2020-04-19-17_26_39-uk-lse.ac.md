If you are studying for a double degree or participating in one of our exchanges in China, we recommend you follow the Chinese government’s official advice and any instructions given by your local university, and keep abreast of any [World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus).

While you are overseas, we also recommend that you regularly check for any advice from your nearest relevant embassy or diplomatic mission in China, as they may also publish guidance which will be useful to you and as the situation changes. 

The [Foreign and Commonwealth Office](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china) (FCO) advise that if you’re in China and able to leave, you should do so. If you need further support, contact global@lse.ac.uk.
