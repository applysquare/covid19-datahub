The duration for completing the individual assessments that have replaced on-site Summer Term exams vary from course to course, and have been designed to give you the flexibility to plan and balance the tasks required across the whole assessment period. 

With the new timetable we have, where possible, made the spacing of assessment as equitable as possible, which means that some submissions dates have changed.  

For assessments in which you are given a 24-hour period in which to complete your assessment, the date is the same as it would have been if you sat the assessment as an in-person examination.  

However, it has not been possible to keep all assessment submission dates the same. Where exams were replaced by longer coursework pieces, some release and submission dates have had to change to accommodate their new format. 

Whilst this may mean some of your assessments are earlier that you may have expected, these alterations help to ensure that students arenâ€™t overloaded with work in a short timeframe and giving students enough time to complete all assessments was our priority in designing the timetable.
