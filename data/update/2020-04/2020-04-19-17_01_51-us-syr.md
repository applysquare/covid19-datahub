Campus & Community

Dear Members of the Syracuse University Community:

As Syracuse University continues to adapt and respond in real time to the evolving COVID-19 health emergency, keeping our community informed remains a top priority. To that end, I appreciate the faculty, staff and students who have reached out to me over the last several weeks with good questions and smart suggestions positioned to enhance the effectiveness and usability of our ongoing Coronavirus Update messages. One of those smart suggestions came to me directly from a student, and we’re implementing that suggestion beginning today.

Specifically, this student suggested—given the breadth of topics and constituencies addressed in these updates—that the reader would benefit from an overview of the issues addressed in each Coronavirus Update message. Doing so would allow for quick navigation to the topics most relevant and uniquely important to each individual or group. Thank you for this suggestion. While I will continue to urge all members of our community to read our updates in their entirety, moving forward we will outline the contents of each Coronavirus Update at the opening of the message.

Today’s message includes information and updates as follows:

For University Community an update on Commencement 2020 new information related to remote work an important update on Summer Session II highlighting the “Orange Moments” initiative information on new library resources

For Students and Families virtual engagement opportunities and resources An important reminder on the pass/fail deadline Food Services and delivery expansion information on a textbook buyback

For Faculty and Staff information on parking credit an update related to protective wear and sanitation COVID-19 information for families with children an important reminder on Materials Distribution and Mail Services



For University Community

Commencement 2020: As Chancellor Syverud announced yesterday, after hearing from thousands of our graduating students via the Commencement survey, the University will hold the 2020 Commencement in our stadium this fall. More details will be provided by June 1.

Remote Working Continues: In alignment with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s extension of his “New York State on PAUSE” Executive Order, our faculty and staff will continue to work remotely through at least Wednesday, April 29. This extension excludes individuals deemed essential who continue to provide critical services to our students remaining in University housing. Any questions about changes to your remote work arrangement should be discussed with your supervisor or senior HR business partner. We will continue to monitor guidance from the state and share any new information.

Summer Session II: As detailed in a message from University Registrar Siham Doughman, the University is moving all previously scheduled residential courses to online delivery for the Summer Session II term, which runs from June 29-Aug. 7. For students planning to take summer courses who haven’t already contacted their academic advisor, please schedule an appointment through Orange SUccess or via email.

Orange Moments: As part of the University’s ongoing engagement with community members who are spread out across the globe, we are asking you to share your “Orange Moments.” Tell us how you’re staying connected to the Syracuse University community—by tagging @SyracuseU on Twitter or Instagram, using #SyracuseU, or messaging the University’s main Facebook page. Your posts may be featured in the short video series “Orange Moments,” which showcases positive moments from around our community. You can watch the latest “Orange Moments” videos on the University’s main Facebook and Twitter accounts.

New Library Resources: Syracuse University Libraries has recently added two important online subscriptions: The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Access is available to all students, faculty and staff with a valid Syracuse University NetID and @syr.edu email address, from which you can establish an online account. Instructions and additional information are provided on news.syr.edu.

Other Library Resources: A reminder that any New York state resident may open a free account at the New York Public Library, which would enable you to check out ebooks and other electronic resources. In addition, you may consider an account at Archive.org, an online nonprofit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites and more.

For Students and Families

Virtual Engagement Opportunities and Resources: As a reminder, through the remainder of the semester, our Orange community will continue to come together virtually through activities, services and events. Students can find ways to connect via online resources like the Wellness Portal for health and well-being options, the Cuse Activities portal for student activities and organization information, and the University Events Calendar for virtual events. Students can also connect to services through the Division of Enrollment and the Student Experience, Hendricks Chapel and the Center for Learning and Student Success.

Deadline to Select Pass/Fail Option: As a reminder, the deadline for undergraduate students to select the pass/fail option is Friday, April 10. This is applicable to any undergraduate courses, with the exception of University College online courses. For more information, please read Associate Provost Johnson’s full message.

Food Services Updates and Grubhub Delivery Expansion: Now that all students remaining on campus have relocated to South Campus, Shaw Dining Center has closed. Goldstein Dining Center remains open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day for take-out or delivery via the Grubhub app. Food Services has also partnered with Grubhub to offer expanded delivery options for students living on and off campus. Delivery is now available for the items in the South Campus Express convenience store. Students may also use the Grubhub app to order grocery and health and beauty items, and pay using their meal plans, SUpercard FOOD and PLUS accounts, or by credit or debit card. Deliveries from the convenience store will be made from 10 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Bookstore Virtual Textbook Buyback: The Syracuse University Bookstore—in collaboration with its book partner, MBS—has created an online buyback option for students to sell their unneeded books. Visit the book buyback page on the Bookstore’s website, enter the ISBN information for the books you hope to sell back, print a shipping label, and send the books (via free shipping) to MBS.

For Faculty and Staff

Parking Credit Forthcoming: In a message to faculty and staff with permits, the Office of Parking and Transit Services announced it will apply a credit for unused permit periods for staff and faculty working remotely. When normal business operations resume, and faculty and staff return to campus (or upon the July 31 expiration of permits), Parking and Transit Services will calculate the value of permits during the unused period and apply a credit toward the 2020-21 parking permit fee.

Protective Wear for Employees and Campus Sanitation Procedures: Our essential staff members continuing to work on campus—including Food Services employees, DPS officers, Facilities Services staff, essential researchers and others who offer direct services to students—are now being provided with masks and gloves. This is in alignment with current CDC guidelines encouraging everyone to wear cloth or other homemade masks when out in public.

In addition, the Facilities Services team has taken steps to meticulously clean and sanitize campus spaces, including:

training of all custodial staff with Environmental Health and Safety Services on proper protocols for cleaning and disinfecting spaces, including wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE);

using four Clorox 360 Electrostatic Sprayers to disinfect high-traffic areas (these were also used during the campus mumps outbreak in fall 2017);

using EPA-registered disinfectants and cleaning products and following all CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting all campus facilities; and

following New York State guidelines for higher education institutions and working with the Onondaga County Health Department to ensure a safe and healthy environment.

COVID-19 Information for Families with Children: Human Resources (HR) continues to aggregate helpful information on its website to support faculty and staff from across the University. Recently, HR partnered with Carebridge, the University’s faculty and staff assistance program, to develop resources, tips and suggestions on how to talk with children about the pandemic, activities to keep children active while home, how to balance work and family, and so much more. Visit the new HR web page to learn more.

Materials Distribution and Mail Services: The team in Materials Distribution and Mail Services continues to provide a critical service to the University community. The office, which is located at Hawkins Warehouse (1600 Jamesville Ave.), is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for mail/package pickup and drop-off and email/regular mail distribution. To continue receiving mail/package delivery, schedule pickups or put a hold on all mail and packages until further notice, email mailsrvc@syr.edu or call 315.443.2803. To make materials distribution arrangements, email materials@syr.edu or call 315.443.2446.

Please continue to share your feedback, as we are committed to keeping you informed throughout this uncertain time. Be healthy and well, and take good care of yourselves, your families and each other.

Sincerely,

J. Michael Haynie

Vice Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation
