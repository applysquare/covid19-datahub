Changes to frequency of Covid-19 email updates

We hope that you have found the Covid-19 email updates a useful source of important information over the last few weeks. We want to make sure that we are providing relevant updates to you when new information is available.

We also want to make sure that we are not overloading you with unnecessary information and for this reason, from Monday 20 April, we will send out email updates twice a week, unless there is an urgent update to share with you.

The changing nature of this crisis means the days we will email you may vary, but please be assured we will keep you updated.

We will continue to regularly update our FAQs( https://www.dur.ac.uk/coronavirus/faq/students/ ) and if you have a question, please continue to send these to coronavirus.information@durham.ac.uk

Message to international students from Universities Minister

Universities Minister, Michelle Donelan MP, has written a message of support to international students during Covid-19. The letter( https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/International/Documents/Letter%20from%20Minister%20Donelan%20to%20International%20Students%20090420.pdf ) also provides some helpful links to health, well-being, and other resources.

Online student services

While many of our services aren’t operating face-to-face at the moment, please be assured you can still access services online, including library services( https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/ ) to continue to support your learning and research, as well as our careers service( https://www.dur.ac.uk/careers/students/ ) and student support and wellbeing( https://www.dur.ac.uk/colleges.se.office/studentsupport/ ).

Conclusion

Once again we want to thank you for your understanding and patience during this difficult time. We really very much appreciate it.

Please continue to take care of your own well-being, and that of your families and friends, while following the latest public health advice.

Best wishes,

Claire O’Malley
