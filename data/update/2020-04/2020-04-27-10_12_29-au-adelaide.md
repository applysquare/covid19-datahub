If you are wanting to arrange your own overseas study trip, you must register your program through GLAS [here.](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/study-overseas/register-your-program)  
   
On 14 April a decision was made by the University of Adelaide to suspend non-essential student travel until the end of 2020.    
   
Programs commencing on or after 1 January 2021 can be considered from 1 August 2020 but these dates will be reviewed by 6 July 2020. If it is deemed safe and appropriate by 6 July 2020 for the travel approval suspension to be lifted, students will be able to register their overseas travel details through GLAS and seek approval from their Faculty from by 1 August 2020.  
   
Students are not advised to make any financial commitments for any overseas program/s until faculty approval has been confirmed in their GLAS registration.
