Once you have completed all your assessments and exams, and these have been marked, the Board of Examiners will be able to meet and confer your degree. Once your degree has been conferred, you will be able to view the final result through your Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) or academic statement, both of which can be accessed through MyEd.  We are currently working to confirm a schedule of when Boards of Examiners will meet.
