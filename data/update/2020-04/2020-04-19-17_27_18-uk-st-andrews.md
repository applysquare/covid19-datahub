The University is delivering all of its teaching and learning in an online format. Postgraduate research (PGR) students who are delivering teaching in this format will continue to be paid for preparation, delivery and marking.

If PGR students who teach do not have the requisite technical equipment to deliver teaching online, they should contact their Directors of Teaching (DoT) to arrange to borrow equipment where possible.
