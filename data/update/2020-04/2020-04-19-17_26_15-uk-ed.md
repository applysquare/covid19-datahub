  * Final year undergraduate students who are required to submit a dissertation should still submit their work, even if due to current circumstances it is not finished or up to the standard they had planned or hoped for. Your School will be in touch to advise you if the deadlines for submission have changed.
  * Postgraduate taught students are expected to prepare for the dissertation phase of their studies following the completion of the taught phase. We recognise that for some of you it will be necessary to change the focus of your dissertation to reflect changed circumstances, and your School will be ready to support you with that.
