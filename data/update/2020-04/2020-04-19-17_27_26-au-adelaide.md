The University has moved lectures and tutorials online.

Friday 3 April is the last day coursework students will be able to attend tutorials in person.

However, our campus will remain open and available for the following reasons:

  * For students who are unable to engage in remote learning from home and need access to computer labs
  * Coursework and HDR students who may need access to University facilities
  * Research staff who need to continue their work on campus
  * Maintenance of essential services and facilities.



Students and staff who choose to be on campus will be required to comply with current social distance recommendations at all times.
