**Continuing Students**  
Continuing students (those with no possibility of graduating in May 2020) will be  
provided an additional semester of academic probation during their next enrolled  
term.

  
 **Graduating Students**  
Students with a UF GPA below 2.0 (and any other required GPA) in courses required  
to graduate are strongly encouraged to keep these classes letter-graded in order to  
make every attempt to improve their GPA. If they earn above a 2.0 UF GPA by  
including their Spring 2020 required class grades, they will be allowed to graduate. If  
they do not earn above a 2.0 UF GPA, they will be allowed one additional semester of  
probation.

  
Students with a UF GPA below 2.0 who select S-U grading for courses required to  
graduate will not be allowed to graduate but, rather, will be given an additional  
semester of probation.
