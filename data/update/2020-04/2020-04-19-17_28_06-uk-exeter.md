We have postponed our summer ceremonies.

We appreciate this will be disappointing news but we will still be able to make awards for finalists who are expecting to complete their studies this summer. As we consider options for rearranging the graduation celebrations we will engage with students on the various options and be guided by you as to how we deliver the graduation ceremonies for this yearâ€™s finalists.

We are working on the process to issue certificates and or transcripts to those who will need them and will provide more details in due course.
