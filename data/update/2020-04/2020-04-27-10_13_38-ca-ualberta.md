### About the U of A response to COVID-19

During the global COVID-19 pandemic the University of Alberta community has quickly adapted to extraordinary change and challenges within our everyday work, research, and study environments. Our multifaceted response has included creatively mobilizing teams and resources to quickly move the majority of our academic and research activities off-campus while health measures prevent in-person classes and groups. Our community is also contributing to response efforts across Alberta, Canada, and the globe — not only through essential research, but also through essential community response resources. It has been and continues to be both a demanding and rewarding time for the U of A as we plan for many continued unknowns in the months ahead. Learn more about the structure and scope of the U of A’s response to COVID-19 in the new [About section on this site](../../about/index.html).

### Fall 2020 Planning

Many unknowns still exist globally and locally when it comes to COVID-19 and what lies ahead. While public health authorities have not indicated any definitive timelines for current prevention measures and restrictions affecting our community, university planners can still plan ahead with flexibility using the informed advice of public health, pandemic, and emergency management experts. The University of Alberta has established a Fall 2020 Planning Group of a steering committee and six sub-groups to oversee planning for the Fall 2020 Academic Term.
