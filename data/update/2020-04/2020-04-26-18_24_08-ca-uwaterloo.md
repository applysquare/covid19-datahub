Update for future students

We’re looking forward to welcoming you to the University of Waterloo this Fall. We hope we can welcome you to campus in person in September, but we will only do so if it’s safe to do so.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we remain committed to delivering an outstanding Fall Term, no matter where you are. Our teams are working on plans for an excellent Fall semester that includes academically challenging courses and hands on learning to help you achieve your educational goals.
