**On April 15,** Jill Dolan sent an [email](http://emergency.princeton.edu/node/622) to faculty about end-of-semester academic processes.

On April 15, the University emailed its weekly [Community COVID-19 Newsletter](http://emergency.princeton.edu/node/620) to all students, faculty, staff, postdocs and researchers. This edition of the newsletter introduced the University’s new [“We Roar” podcast](http://weroar.princeton.edu/?utm_source=allemployees&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=communications) to share the personal stories and expertise of Princetonians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first four episodes, including a conversation with President Christopher L. Eisgruber, are available now.

The newsletter also contained information on the University’s [plans for Commencement in light of COVID-19](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/04/15/princeton-university-confer-degrees-class-2020-virtual-ceremony-may-31) and President Eisgruber’s letter to members of the Class of 2020 and their families; stories about how the [University has been helping communities close to home and throughout New Jersey](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/04/10/university-strives-support-new-jersey-communities-during-coronavirus-pandemic) as they respond to the public health emergency and address local food insecurity; how University staff and faculty can volunteer to lend their support through the [COVID-19 Response Special Activities and Resources Group](https://ehs.princeton.edu/covid19-response-activities) (SARG); and [new faculty research projects](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/04/10/princeton-awards-over-half-million-dollars-funding-rapid-novel-and-actionable-covid) aimed at accelerating solutions to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
