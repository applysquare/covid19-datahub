It is likely that our [pre-sessional programmes](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/entry-requirements/pre-sessional-english-language-courses/) will be taught online. We are working through the details and further information will be posted here as soon as it available.

If you have been offered a place or if you are eligible for a pre-sessional programme we will be in touch with you as soon as possible.
