  * As the semester resumes, watch the [latest video update ](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students)with the most recent information for students from our Vice-President for Education, Professor Wyn Morgan.
  * The University Library is hosting a Copyright Forum on Monday 27 April, covering how temporary changes to copyright can assist remote teaching. More details in our [Staff FAQs](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/staff) along with advice about managing information security whilst working from home, right to work eligibility and the new arrangements for sending/receiving business post.
  * We have updated the [Student FAQs](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students) with information for students planning a year in industry or study abroad placement and have questions about how any changing plans will affect their student finance.
  * [Our research and innovation](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/research/coronavirus) highlights all the amazing research our colleagues are doing to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on society, with a rapid response through innovative research and collaboration
  * We have introduced a safety net policy for all exams and assessments due to take place. This will recognise the value of marks students have already achieved up to **March 2020** for assessed work. This means that no student who passes the year will receive an average mark or overall degree class lower than their current overall mark or degree class.  
  * Government advice states that people **must stay at home** and should only leave for one of four reasons: shopping for basic necessities, including food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible; one form of exercise a day - alone or with members of your household; any medical need or to provide care for a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from essential work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home. **It is absolutely imperative that staff and students adhere to this.**
  * **Student travel home within the UK is no longer classed as essential**. Students should remain where they are currently living and follow social distancing rules - see [advice for current students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students) for more information.
  * Staff carrying out **business critical work** that requires them to be on campus - where there is a significant consequence to health, safety and welfare if the work cannot continue - should have been notified and must carry a valid photo ID/UCard with them at all times.
  * Stay at home for seven days if you have a high temperature and/or a new continuous cough. Anyone sharing your household will need to also stay at home for 14 days from when you first developed symptoms.
  * The best defence to prevent the spread of coronavirus continues to be **good hand hygiene practices** and **social distancing**.
