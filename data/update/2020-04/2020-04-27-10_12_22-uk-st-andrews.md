The lockdown applies to UK citizens. Students from overseas are encouraged to head home if it’s safe for them to do so and if commercial flights are still available.

Please be aware international travel is becoming very limited as air routes close, land borders close, and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving.

Also, if you are showing any symptoms, or share a household with someone showing symptoms, you should not travel and should self-isolate.

If fit for travel check [Foreign Office guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus) and [NHS travel advice](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/novel-coronavirus-wuhan-china-infection).
