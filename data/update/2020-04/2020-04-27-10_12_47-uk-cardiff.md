#### Remote learning

As we move toward working remotely, we have created some [guidance around remote learning](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/xapi_launch.php?template_id=11728&group=student#resume=1) to help you make the most of your time whilst you are unable to physically attend University.

Our teaching staff will be making decisions about the most appropriate way to move your learning activities online.  You should follow any specific information from your Academic School but this remote learning guidance includes help with some of the most common remote learning activities:

  * watching videos and lecture recordings
  * webinars and virtual classrooms
  * presentations
  * one-to-one meetings
  * group work
  * video submission
  * study skills.

#### Accessing study skills support from home

We have online tutorials to help with key aspects of essay writing. Just search 'study skills' on the [student intranet](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students) and click on the relevant pages.

#### Help with referencing

Referencing is taught by the Library staff. There is guidance and tutorials on [the student intranet](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students). You can find it by searching ‘study skills’.
