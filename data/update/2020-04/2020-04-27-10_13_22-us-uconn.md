![UConn Nation Physically Distant, socially and globally connected](https://uconn.edu/content/uploads/2020/03/uconn-nation-distancing-300x295.png)The worldwide pandemic involving COVID-19 (coronavirus) has produced unprecedented challenges in the UConn community and around the world.

We recognize that these unusual circumstances create significant uncertainty and unease in the professional and personal lives of our students, employees, alumni, and others throughout UConn Nation. The University cares about your well being, and we encourage you to exercise compassion for each other and to know that your perseverance during these unusual times is greatly appreciated and admired.

To help you navigate the significant amount of information that these circumstances have required, here’s an overview of UConn’s major announcements to date:

  * UConn’s courses at Storrs, the regional campuses and School of Law have moved to online delivery through the remainder of the 2020 spring semester, including final exams. Undergraduate students can elect to take their [courses on a pass/fail basis](covid-19-academics-and-research/#AR-2020-03-19-a). Additional details will continue to be posted under the [Academics](covid-19-academics-and-research/) link at right.
  * May "in-person" Commencement exercises have been canceled. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the University anticipates offering an in-person [Commencement celebration](https://commencement2020.uconn.edu/) during the Oct. 9-11 Celebration Weekend.
  * The UConn Stamford campus is [closed entirely](covid-19-campus-operations/#HOME-2020-03-12-b) until further notice.
  * Students should remain at home or elsewhere in accordance with state and federal guidelines. [Residential Life](https://reslife.uconn.edu/covid-19-faq/) will communicate directly to students as to how and when belongings can be retrieved. Students who were approved by Residential Life to stay because they have nowhere else to go have been allowed to remain on campus. Dining options and other essential services continue to be provided to those students.
  * Employees at Storrs, the regional campuses and School of Law who can [telecommute](https://confluence.uconn.edu/ikb/it-guide-to-telecommuting) should plan to work from home, with their supervisor’s approval, until further notice. Human Resources addresses this and many other questions in its [guidance letter and FAQ for employees](covid-19-human-resources/), and will be working with unit leaders to continue to reduce the number of employees working on our campuses in the days ahead.
  * All on-campus research activities at all UConn locations, including UConn Health, have stopped and labs have closed until further notice. Further guidance for active researchers and industry partners is available on the [Research](covid-19-research/) link at right.
  * When UConn Health identifies COVID-19 positive patients, it takes all precautions recommended by the CDC to protect staff, visitors, patients, and learners. Please refer to [COVID-19 UConn Health Updates](https://health.uconn.edu/coronavirus/) for the latest clinical updates.
  * No events larger than 5 people are permitted at any UConn location. This includes all events, meetings and performances, which should be canceled or postponed if they involve more than 5 people.
  * UConn Athletics has canceled all events for the remainder of the academic year, including all spring teams. This is consistent with the NCAA’s decision to cancel all scheduled spring championship competition.
  * The School of Fine Arts and its venues, including the Jorgensen Center for the Performing Arts, Connecticut Repertory Theatre, the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry, and the William Benton Museum of Art will remain physically closed through the summer season and have shifted to an online format.
