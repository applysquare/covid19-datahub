For students in receipt of a stipend, the University is considering advice from different funding bodies, and this is an evolving situation. The University is communicating with funders on behalf of students, and is working to ensure that any negative consequences are minimised.

At the moment, all postgraduate researchers (PGRs) in receipt of a stipend will continue to be paid as normal.
