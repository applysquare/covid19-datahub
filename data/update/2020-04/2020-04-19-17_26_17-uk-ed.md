  * This refers to a timed, take-home exam offered remotely for which you may use the text or material you have been studying.
  * In most cases, take-home, open-book exams will be made available for you to complete within a 48-hour period. You do not need to spend 48 hours working on your answer! An open-book exam paper will typically take approximately the same length of time as the original to complete; the extra time allows all students to complete comfortably, including where they normally receive additional time to complete an exam as a reasonable adjustment. The 48-hour period applies no matter your personal circumstances or which time zone you are in.
  * A small number of take-home exams (primarily in quantitative subjects such as Mathematics, Informatics, Physics and Astronomy, and Economics), plus some with strict professional body requirements, will be offered with a shorter time allocation, which will be the time scheduled for the original, in-person exam (usually 2-3 hours), plus one hour to submit your finished work. Your School will advise you of the details where this applies to you.
  * Your open book exam answers will be checked by Turnitin software to monitor for plagiarism and collusion.
