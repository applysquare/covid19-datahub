With COVID-19 community transmission continuing in the United States and globally, TCU has now suspended all University-sponsored domestic and international travel until August 1, 2020 or until further notice.  Exceptions to this travel suspension must be approved by the appropriate Vice Chancellor via email. In the event that international travel is approved by a Vice Chancellor, it must be registered using the [TCU Faculty & Staff Authorizations & Registration](https://studyabroad.tcu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/international-travel-registry/) system. The University requests that non-essential personal travel to domestic and international regions with community transmission be reconsidered.
