Due to the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus (Covid-19) the University has no choice but to postpone its July 2020 graduation ceremonies. Graduation is an important part of the university experience, and these ceremonies will be rescheduled. All students will be given the opportunity to graduate in person at a future date. Students from the class of 2020 will be informed of the new dates for our graduation ceremonies when they become available.

However, it is crucial final-year students are clear that they will still be able to graduate, in absentia in the Summer, as expected.
