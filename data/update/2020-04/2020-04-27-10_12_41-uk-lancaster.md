The University accepts a variety of English Language tests, please look at our [english language requirements](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/entry-requirements/english-language-requirements/) pages for more information.

The British Council have advised that IELTS exams have been suspended in many parts of the world. If you cannot book an IELTS test, you might be able to use a test you have taken previously to support your application for academic study. IELTS remain valid for two years from the test date.

To meet the needs of students who are unable to take the ToEFL iBT test at a test centre, ETS is temporarily offering the [ToEFL iBT Special Home Edition](https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/) test.

Students from the European Union may be able to demonstrate their English language proficiency using alternative means. Please contact us for further advice:
