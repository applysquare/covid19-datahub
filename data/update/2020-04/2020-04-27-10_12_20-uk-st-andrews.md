At this stage, we hope that 2020-2021 Study Abroad placements will not be affected by the current situation. However, it is possible that there may be disruption in some locations around the world.

We are working closely with our partners in Australia and New Zealand to determine whether students due to start placements there in July will still be able to do so. We will also be in touch with students directly who are due to start work placements during the summer.

We will be in regular contact over the upcoming weeks and will be providing comprehensive pre-departure information.

If you have specific questions about your placement, please contact the Global Office at [**outbound@st-andrews.ac.uk**](mailto:outbound@st-andrews.ac.uk) **.**
