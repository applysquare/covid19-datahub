iSolutions provides advice and guidance for students about working remotely (away from campus) [on their 'Away from campus' webpage](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/isolutions/students/away-from-campus.page).

International students, please ensure that you are remaining compliant with the conditions of your visa, see our [specific Visa webpage](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/studentservices/visa-and-immigration/covid-19-information-for-current-visa-students.page)

The University plans to commence teaching online at the start of the summer term, with all assessment conducted remotely. Please familiarise yourself with the advice found at the iSolutions link above so that you are prepared to begin your studies again after the Easter break.
