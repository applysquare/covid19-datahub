Annual Progress Reviews will now all be conducted online. Where the normal format for reviews in your School involves a face-to-face element, such as presentations, they will be adjusted appropriately by the School.

Expectations for student progress will be adjusted in light of the disruption caused by COVID-19. Schools should provide guidance to research students about any changes to the requirements for the annual progress review.
