In order to lessen the stress and anxiety as a result of the unfolding challenges of COVID-19, interest and late payment fines on outstanding student accounts are waived for the April 28 payment due date. The fee assessment for summer 2020 has now taken place and students can see the assessment on Minerva. The fees will be billed on the May 5th e-bill.
