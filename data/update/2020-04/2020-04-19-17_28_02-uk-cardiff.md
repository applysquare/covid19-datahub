Due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, colleagues in Academic Schools are reviewing and, if necessary, revising the methods and format of assessment to enable the remote assessment of learning outcomes to be completed by the end of the session.

It is possible that the assessments you were expecting to undertake before the end of the session will change. You will receive notifications from your Academic School via email and Learning Central on the arrangements for remote assessment. We will be producing further guidance shortly but we can assure our students that we will be implementing a no-detriment approach.

### Coursework

You should continue to complete and submit all coursework assessments in the normal way, unless informed otherwise by your Academic School.

Your Academic Schools will contact you directly via email and Learning Central when necessary to inform you of any matters relating to assessments.
