During the COVID-19 outbreak, research students (excluding MSc(Res) and MSt(Res) students) will be able to submit their thesis electronically through [ **Moodle**](https://moody.st-andrews.ac.uk/moodle/). The temporary arrangement applies both to submission of copies for examination (pre-viva, equivalent to soft-bound copies) and to submission of final copies for graduation (equivalent to hard-bound copy and CD). You can find further guidance on the process in the ‘Thesis submission during Covid-19 outbreak’ section, in the [ **Research thesis submission webpage**](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pgstudents/academic/theses/).

 All postgraduate (PGR) theses whose submission deadline is in March or April 2020 will be allowed to submit their theses until 1 May 2020 without any detriment.

Students due to submit corrections following their viva should work towards their original deadline. If you have experienced significant delays in completing your corrections due to COVID-19 disruptions please speak to your internal examiner who can liaise with the PGR Pro Dean about an extension.
