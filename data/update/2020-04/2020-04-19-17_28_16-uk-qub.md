Unfortunately, in order to reduce the risk of spread of the Covid-19 (coronavirus), we have taken the decision to postpone graduation ceremonies this summer. We appreciate this is disappointing for many but the health and wellbeing of our staff and students is our priority. We are making the this decision as early as possible to try and help families avoid incurring additional expense in terms of travel.
