COVID-19 Research Funding Opportunities

COVID-19 funding opportunities for both research projects and Research & Development activities are listed in the Research Services Office’s funding opportunities database. COVID-19 opportunities are being prioritized and are added as they are received. Please check back regularly as the situation is very fluid and funder timelines can be very short.

New Restrictions for Field Research

Staying safe and abiding by the public health restrictions that have been put in place locally, federally, and across the globe is something we all must do. That holds true for the research that would normally be conducted in the field. Please check the Restrictions on Field Research webpage to review the latest information for field researchers - including an update about the approval of new projects.

FAQs for Postdocs

The COVID-19 crisis has created some unique issues for the university's postdoctoral fellows. To see how to best navigate the implications of COVID-19 on their work at the U of A, postdoctoral fellows are encouraged to regularly visit the Frequently Asked Questions for Postdoctoral Fellows webpage.
