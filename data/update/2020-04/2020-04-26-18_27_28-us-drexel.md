The following message was sent to the campus community on April 20.

Dear Students and Colleagues,

Just as the nation's leaders are considering the logistics of a phased restart of the U.S. economy, we are examining the best and safest means for the University to conduct classes and research during the coming months. As much as we all would welcome a return to full campus activity, it is clear that the most prudent plan for now is that Drexel should, for the most part, continue to operate remotely.

In keeping with this approach, all undergraduate and graduate courses will be conducted online during the summer term, largely following the same procedures in use now during the spring quarter and semester. Further details on the summer term will be provided soon.

As the summer progresses, we do hope to open the campuses on a limited basis. This could involve bringing back small groups of students and researchers, additional faculty, and professional staff and other personnel necessary to conduct University business. Some labs could reopen, with experiments and demonstrations shown online for the benefit of students and researchers still working from home.

Any move to resume on-campus operations will be made only after state and local authorities lift restrictions on business and school openings, and once the University concludes that safeguards can be put in place to minimize health risks from COVID-19 to the Drexel community. We would expect that social-distancing rules would remain in effect, enhanced cleaning would continue, and that we would have adequate personal protective equipment on hand for use by anyone on campus.

In the meantime, we have formed a task force to look at options for the fall term to be co-chaired by Norma Bouchard, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences; Alan Greenberger, Westphal College architecture department chair; and, Megan Weyler, chief human resources officer. Anna Koulas, from the Drexel Solutions Institute, will staff this group. Fall classes will begin on schedule and our goal would be to resume on-campus operations to the greatest extent possible, consistent with proper health and safety measures. We also plan to hold a delayed University-wide Commencement for 2020 graduates during the fall term.

We understand the anxiety that many of us are experiencing amid the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, and we are deeply grateful for your understanding as we work through the challenges and opportunities that it poses for Drexel.

Please continue to check Drexel's Response to Coronavirus website for updates and utilize the CDC's prevention tips. Take care of yourselves, and each other. We will be back in touch with further details on Drexel's plans for moving ahead.

Sincerely,

John Fry

President
