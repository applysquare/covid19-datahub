Colleagues in Academic Schools are working hard to ensure we offer  remote learning opportunities through Learning Central, Panopto and, where appropriate, subject specific online applications. We are working to ensure the quality of the student experience and our high standards are maintained throughout this changing and unprecedented disruption.

You will receive notifications from your Academic School via e-mail and Learning Central on the arrangements for remote learning.

In addition, you are able to access the electronic library and journals to support your studies.

You already have access to Learning Central module resources and it will be important that you keep accessing this to receive information, engage with academic staff and continue your learning.
