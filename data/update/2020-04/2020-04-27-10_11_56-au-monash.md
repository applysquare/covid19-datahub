  * Students requiring the completion of their course or unit to progress to another course or unit will not be impacted, as they will have received their results before the semester one census date. Students can commence in a unit for which they have not successfully completed the prerequisite unit or course due to the deferred exams. If students did not successfully pass the deferred exam, they will need to have withdrawn from any units for which they are no longer eligible by census date, and have enrolled in units for which they are eligible.
  * For those students transferring to another institution or conducting further study at another institution, please contact [Monash Connect](https://www.monash.edu/connect) and we will provide a letter of evidence of special circumstances.
  * Students can add additional units up to 30 March; this will provide them one week between the release of results and the deadline for joining new units.
