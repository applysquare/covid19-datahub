If you defer until later this summer, the form of the assessment would remain the same as if you were taking it in May, e.g. an open-book remote examination, rather than an invigilated on-campus examination. If you defer until the next academic year, then the form of the assessment may revert back to its original form; however, we cannot predict that far ahead.
