Face-to-face summer exams will not take place.

Instead, there will be on-line assessments focused on the achievement of learning outcomes. For accredited courses, these online assessments will meet requirements of professional and regulatory bodies. No student will be disadvantaged in relation to assessments by the changes that we have had to make as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

 **[Assessment changes due to coronavirus](http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/study/assessment-changes-due-to-coronavirus/) provides up-to-date and complete guidance on our alternative arrangements for students. **
