In the wake of the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the University is waiving the following student fees, where applicable, across all campuses for students enrolled in courses during summer 2020 sessions: The Student Activity Fee; Wellness Fee; Student Health Service Fee; Security, Safety, and Transportation Fee; Student Facility Fee; and Student Recreation Fee. The University continues to provide as many services as possible, remotely, to ensure uninterrupted access whenever possible.  
  
The Computing and Network Service Fees will be required as a mandatory fee for summer sessions.
