We regret that graduation ceremonies in Summer 2020 will not be running. We currently expect that degree certificates for students entitled to graduate this summer will be printed and mailed by the end of July 2020, with graduates being offered a series of options: 

  * to defer to an in-person ceremony in Winter 2020 or Summer 2021
  * to attend a virtual graduation
  * to receive their certificate and not attend a ceremony
