All grades will be made available on Access Adelaide.  
   
Once your grade is available, you will be able to submit an online form to request an NGP as your final grade on your academic transcript, if you wish to receive.  

The change to record for Fails to Withdraw No Fail (WNF) will be automatically applied for Withdraw Fail (WF), Fail No Submission (FNS) and Fail (F) results. Notwithstanding this change, students will still need to repeat the course if it is a required course for their program or a prerequisite for ongoing study.
