Dear students, faculty, and staff,

As the spring semester draws to a close, we continue to evaluate and refine our pass/fail grading policy. As each of you know, these are extraordinary times that require additional flexibility on the part of the university. Some students and families are enduring remarkable hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address these issues, we will allow undergraduate students to take some or all courses pass/fail this semester. Summer grading will return to the normal rules.

Policy (effective immediately) : Undergraduate students may—but are not required to—change some or all classes to pass/fail any time before midnight on the last day of classes, April 14, 2020. Instructions for how to petition for pass/fail can be found on the Registrar’s website: https://registrar.northeastern.edu/

Students should consult with their academic advisors if they have questions about the implications of opting for pass/fail grading.

Best wishes for a safe and healthy conclusion of the semester.

Sincerely,

James C. Bean

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs
