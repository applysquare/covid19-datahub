Yes, face-to-face classes including lectures, laboratory-based classes, seminars and tutorials at the Liverpool and London campuses are cancelled for the remainder of the 2019/20 academic year. You should now be accessing the alternative arrangements put in place for you to continue your learning online so that your progress is unaffected by this change.

If you are studying on a clinical programme (in the Dental, Health Sciences, Medical or Veterinary Schools) you will already have had guidance from your school about what to do next.

If you are a Postgraduate Researcher you will have been contacted by your supervisor with further instructions.
