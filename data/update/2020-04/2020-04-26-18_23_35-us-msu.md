MSU will hold virtual commencement ceremony on May 16

Michigan State University will hold a virtual commencement celebration on May 16 for all undergraduate and graduate students earning degrees at the end of the 2020 spring semester.

The university postponed its May 1 in-person commencement due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The virtual event does not replace an in-person ceremony and members of the class of 2020 will be invited to participate in a future in-person commencement.

“From a public health standpoint, it simply isn’t safe to hold a traditional ceremony at this time. But the class of 2020 still deserves to celebrate graduation; it is a momentous occasion,” said President Samuel L. Stanley Jr., M.D. “This class has shown incredible resiliency and I couldn’t be prouder. It is disappointing to be unable to express that in person, but we’ve found a way to overcome this challenge — that is what Spartans do.”

The virtual ceremony will be held via MSU’s Facebook page beginning at 10 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. PDT) May 16. Members of the 2020 class, their friends, families, and Spartans everywhere are invited to gather online and make this the largest MSU commencement ever, as university leadership recognizes graduates and confers their degrees. The ceremony will feature remarks from Stanley and the interim provost as well as musical performances from students in the College of Music.

“I encourage graduates to put on their caps and gowns to celebrate with us,” said Teresa A. Sullivan, MSU’s interim provost. “That way when the president confers the degrees, they can all move their tassels from the right side of the cap to the left together. It is a symbol of their achievement, the support they’ve received from friends and family and going out into the world to do great things as Spartans.”

A recording of the virtual ceremony will be available on the MSU commencement webpage following the Facebook event.

Virtual events and ceremonies also are being planned by many individual colleges within MSU. Please check college websites for details.
