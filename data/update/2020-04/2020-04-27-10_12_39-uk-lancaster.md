Yes, we can make decisions on your application if you provide a copy of your interim transcript showing your marks to date. Undergraduate applicants should complete as much information as possible about their qualifications on the UCAS application.

Please note that, if you will require a Tier 4 visa to study in the UK, you will need to meet the conditions of your offer before we can issue you with a confirmation of acceptance of studies number (CAS).
