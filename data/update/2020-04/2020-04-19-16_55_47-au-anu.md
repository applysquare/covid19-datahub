We believe that anyone with the will and talent should have the opportunity to study at Australia's national university.

Students, particularly those in their final year of school, have experienced a very tough year already, and at the very least, their studies will have been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis.

We want to give our students the comfort of certainty in uncertain times.

That's why we have improved the way we will admit undergraduate Australian students to our courses commencing in 2021.

You will be able to come and study at ANU in 2021, based on your Year 11 results. But, if your Year 12 results are better than your Year 11 results, we will consider them instead.

These improvements build on our sector-leading admissions process-which consider a student's all-round character, including community engagement and leadership, alongside Year 11 and ATAR results.You can apply now until 25 May. We will be making offers in August - giving you more certainty and time to plan for one of the biggest decisions of your life; where to study at university.
