4/11: UB statement on virtual commencement

We understand our studentsâ€™ disappointment regarding the decision to transition to a virtual commencement. We sincerely appreciate that commencement is a significant milestone for our UB students. Every year, we look forward to celebrating this milestone with our graduates, their families and their friends. However, at this moment, we find ourselves in an incredibly challenging situation.

To ensure the health, safety and well-being of our graduates, their loved ones and our entire university community, commencement exercises have been moved to a virtual environment. We remain optimistic that we also will be able to recognize our graduates during on-campus commencement at a later date. Once it is safe to hold commencement, we will notify our graduates and the university community of our plans.
