All programs will accept S grades (equating to C or better) for common course prerequisites  
for each major, regardless of whether these courses require a specific grade  
of C+ or higher. In this regard, they would be treated no differently from native  
students. All students must otherwise meet GPA requirements for competitive  
admission.
