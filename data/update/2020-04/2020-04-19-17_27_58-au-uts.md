As a result of advice from the Australian Government, large non-essential events at UTS are undergoing detailed contingency planning. We will provide further information as it becomes available.

### Graduations

Graduation ceremonies from Wednesday 29 April to Tuesday 19 May have been postponed until further notice.  
  
Itâ€™s too soon to say when UTS will be able to reschedule these ceremonies, but we will keep you informed of any plans for future dates (so keep an eye on your UTS email) and we look forward to celebrating your hard-earned achievement with you.   
  
Please find important information regarding the conferral of your award and official graduation documentation on the [graduation website](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/graduation/graduation).
