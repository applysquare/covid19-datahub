The British Council have advised that all [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/news/2020/changes-to-ielts-test-arrangements-in-some-locations-due-to-novel-coronavirus) exams in some parts of the world are suspended for the duration of March and into April 2020. If you cannot book an IELTS test, you might be able to use an older IELTS result to support your application to academic study at the University. IELTS remain valid for 2 years from the test date.

Please be aware that the University accepts a variety of English Language tests, SELT and non-SELT. Please view our [English language requirements page](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/international/apply/english-language/) for further information.
