Yesterday, Governor Tony Evers announced an extension of his safer at home order through May 26. To comply with this order, Marquette University is extending its remote working environment through May 26, with only critical staff on campus to maintain essential operations. This date may be extended to align with future federal, state or city orders. Faculty and staff monthly parking fees will be waived for May.

This order also means all events on campus are canceled through May 26. Check the university’s dedicated COVID-19 website for updated public health guidance, FAQs, human resources information and more.
