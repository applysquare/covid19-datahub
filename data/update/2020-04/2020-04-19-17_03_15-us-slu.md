In support of the work of our faculty and the success of our students, SLU’s deans and associate deans, as well as staff from the Provost’s Office, Information Technology Services, the Reinert Center and other areas have been meeting regularly to modify policies and practices as needed during this unprecedented time.

As part of the University's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the following key academic decisions have been made. Please note that these decisions are in place for the spring 2020 semester only.

This page will be updated with the latest academic decisions at SLU related to COVID-19. Faculty and students are encouraged to check this page regularly for the most recent academic-related information.
