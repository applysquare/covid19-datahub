We know that there will be a variety of situations that will make it challenging for some of our students to engage with their academic studies. We are currently working to help with data downloads for students with limited internet access. If you believe you will not be able to access remote teaching, or your domestic situation substantially prevents you from engaging effectively with learning material, please seek advice from both Student Services and the Director of Teaching in your School(s).

You will first be supported to remain engaged with your studies through extensions and deferrals and only as a last resort would we consider a leave of absence. If you feel that you are struggling or that your wellbeing is affected, you should not hesitate to contact [Student Services](mailto:theasc@st-andrews.ac.uk) for help.
