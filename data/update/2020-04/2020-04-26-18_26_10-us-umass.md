Good Afternoon CEEC Families,

Governor Baker today extended the order to close all early childhood education programs in the state of Massachusetts until June 29, 2020.

If your child will not be returning to CEEC after June 29, please let us know by Friday, May 1. This can be done by emailing Penny Gagnon in the office at: pgagnon@umass.edu.

If you have any questions regarding deposit refunds or billing, please contact Teresa Wozniak in the office at: thoule@umass.edu

There will be no tuition charge during this period.

Classroom teachers will continue to provide activities and Zoom meetings online and will be in contact with you regarding picking up your childâ€™s belongings.

As I learn more or if events change, I will be in touch.

Please know that we are all thinking of you and miss seeing you and your children!

Stay well,

Maryanne
