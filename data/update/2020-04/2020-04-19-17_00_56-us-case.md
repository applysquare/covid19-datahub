To Our Students:

As you begin your fourth week of remote learning, we want to update you regarding several recent developments. First, though, we want to thank you for your patience and perseverance through these uncertain times. While managing your own enormous adjustments to daily life, you still have found time to help battle this pandemic, support health providers, and even offer gardening tips for when grocery shelves are empty. Your support for one another, and the broader community, continues to inspire.

Student Emergency Fund: Just a quick reminder that this resource is available for all students—those in undergraduate, graduate and professional programs—should you unexpectedly need urgent financial assistance. Details about the program, including how to apply, can be found on the Student Affairs website.

Students Not Feeling Well: Another reminder, just for those living on campus: If you do not feel well, self-isolate and call University Health Services (UHS) at 216.368.2450.

Students Being Tested for COVID-19: Regardless of where you live, please notify UHS at healthservices@case.edu if you have been or are being tested for COVID-19. If you are on campus, please call UHS directly at 216.368.2450. We continue to have fewer than five positive tests reported among members of the campus community (faculty, staff and students).

Commencement I: After extensive discussion and a survey of graduating seniors, the university has decided to hold virtual ceremonies on Sunday, May 17, the original scheduled date for commencement. We will share additional details regarding the weekend’s undergraduate, graduate and professional student graduation events in the coming weeks, but for now please mark your calendars.

Commencement II: Homecoming and Parents’ Weekend will include events for this year’s 2020 graduates. That Sunday, Oct. 11, is reserved for in-person commencement-related activities; for example, undergraduates choosing to attend would receive their diplomas, and hooding ceremonies for those earning advanced degrees also would take place. Again, we will provide additional information as it becomes available.

Summer Study Abroad: We waited to make this decision in hopes the pandemic would abate, but the ongoing uncertainty appears likely to continue—especially with regard to international travel. Given the health risks involved, we have made the difficult decision to cancel summer study abroad programs.

Summer Housing: Given that many of our international students now living on campus may not be able to return to their countries this summer, we are planning to be able to provide them housing. We will provide updates as soon as more information is available.

Fall Courses: We also know that some of our international students now in their home countries may not be able to get back to campus for the new academic year. Given that possibility—as well as others involving renewed infection increases—we are planning to offer courses in both traditional and remote models. These discussions are in their earliest stages, but we wanted at least to inform you of our intended approach now.

We wish all of you a good, healthy and safe weekend.
