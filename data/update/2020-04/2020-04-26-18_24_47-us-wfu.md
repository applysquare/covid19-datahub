On April 15, Wake Forest sent emails to parents and families regarding refunds. On April 17, Wake Forest sent emails to students regarding refunds. The emails differed depending on the student’s refund scenario. Below is a summary of the main points of those emails.

Opening: In March, with the guidance of public health officials, Wake Forest University made the decision to suspend on campus learning and move to remote instruction. On March 30, we communicated that following further guidance and requirements from the State of North Carolina and the City of Winston-Salem, we would not be able to bring all of our students back to campus this semester. These actions were taken to ensure the health and safety of our students and our campus community.

Instructions: Students, parents and families then received instructions regarding their refunds, which are available as of April 17 when the student received an email to begin the process. Most students, parents and families were referred to refunds.wfu.edu for more details.

Communication: Questions about this process may be directed to the Wake Forest Call Center 336-758-7500 (9 a.m.-5 p.m. Eastern) or submitted online.

Crisis Response Fund: A number of families have asked how to contribute some or all of the refund amount to the Wake Forest Crisis Response Fund. The Crisis Response Fund was established to provide support to members of our community experiencing financial hardships resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. Please know, we offer this opportunity with a great deal of humility and do not expect all families to direct all or even part of their refund to the Crisis Response Fund.

Closing: Thank you for your patience as we work through this process for the first time. As many of you have experienced in your own lives, every day brings new, complex changes to our day-to-day operations. Please know that it is of the utmost importance to us to do the right thing for you and your student and deliver on our mission to the very best of our ability.

With my sincere wishes for your continued health and wellbeing,

Hof Milam (’76, MBA ’91, P ’00, P ’01, P ’04)
