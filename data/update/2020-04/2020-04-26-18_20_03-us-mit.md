Thinking of you: A letter to students from the Dean for Student Life

Dear students,

I hope all is well with you, your friends, and your loved ones—we miss you and the energy that you bring to MIT’s corridors, classrooms, labs, and residences. I want to take a few moments to let you know that you’re in my thoughts and to remind you that now, more than ever, it is important to focus on self-care, relations with others, and a sense of purpose.

Many resources available to you on campus—such as S3, GradSupport, Disability and Access Services, and Student Mental Health and Counseling Services—are now available virtually. I also want you to know about other, informal supports that you can access just about any time:

Please know that you can always reach out to me and share your thoughts or ask a question. I am also working on some events that will allow us to connect virtually soon. Until then, we’re sending a lot of MIT love and support your way.

Take care,

Suzy

Suzy Nelson

Vice President and Dean for Student Life
