A Commencement update from President Harvey Stenger

Dear members of the Binghamton University graduating class,

Although we are eager to set a Commencement date to celebrate your accomplishments, there are still many unknown factors facing us, so at this time we cannot finalize a date for our rescheduled ceremonies.

We will take into strong consideration the feedback we received in our survey, which showed a 4-to-1 favorite of Aug. 8−9, and a second-place choice of Oct. 2−3. We are keenly aware that accommodations, reservations and travel arrangements will need to be made, and we intend to give you at least two months’ notice between the time of the announcement and the chosen date.

We hope to provide this information and associated details in the second half of May, as we learn more from New York state government and health officials. However, with the current level of uncertainty, we may need to postpone our decision even further.

I wish this message included more information, but I know you needed an update and this is the best we can do at this time.

Sincerely,

Harvey Stenger

President
