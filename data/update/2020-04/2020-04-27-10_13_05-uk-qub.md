Where possible, viva examinations will be conducted remotely. This should be arranged at School-level using video conferencing software such as Skype or Microsoft Teams. The written agreement of all participants of the viva should be obtained in advance.  These arrangements would also be contingent on there being appropriate resources available in the School to conduct the meeting digitally and that everyone involved is still available on the scheduled date. Where a viva is held remotely, the examination should be conducted in compliance with the [Study Regulations for Research Degree Programmes (7. Assessment/Award).](http://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/AcademicStudentAffairs/AcademicAffairs/GeneralRegulations/StudyRegulations/StudyRegulationsforResearchDegreeProgrammes/#d.en.717768)

Where it is not possible to hold the viva remotely, this should be rescheduled to the next available date, in agreement with the student.
