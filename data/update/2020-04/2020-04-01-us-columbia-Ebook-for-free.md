To address the needs of students who were forced to leave campus during the unfolding COVID-19 crisis without securing their course books, Columbia University Press has joined with VitalSource to make [its titles available for free as e-books](https://www.cupblog.org/2020/03/31/columbia-university-press-makes-e-book-learning-resources-available-to-students-online-at-no-cost/).

In addition to VitalSource, Columbia University Press is working with its e-book partners to provide expanded access at no cost to its entire catalog of books to library patrons around the world.
