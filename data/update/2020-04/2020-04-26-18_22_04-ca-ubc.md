If you are a manager of staff whose work is not computer-based, please print this email and display it in a common work area for them to review.

As you know, the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve with new developments on a daily basis.

Last month we informed you that Term 1 of Summer Session (May 11- June 18) at UBC Vancouver, UBC Okanagan and UBC Robson Square would be online.

In light of the ongoing situation, and in continued support of physical distancing, we are announcing that Summer Term 2 courses (July 6 – Aug. 13) at UBC Vancouver, UBC Okanagan and UBC Robson Square will also be online.

As a reminder, not all courses are easily remodelled for online instruction. In those instances, courses may have to be postponed or redesigned. For classes that cannot be accommodated online, further information will be issued through our Faculties.

As we continue to navigate the challenges associated with COVID-19, we are actively planning for how we might teach in the Fall semester. We appreciate that many of our students, faculty and staff will have questions about teaching and learning as the year progresses.

We also understand this is a challenging time for faculty members, who may need to plan ahead for any changes in how they deliver their courses. We will provide updates as soon as we can. As a reminder, support and resources are available at https://keepteaching.ubc.ca/ and https://ctl.ok.ubc.ca/.

We will do our best to update you as the situation evolves. In the meantime, I would like to thank you, once again, for your patience and flexibility.

Santa J. Ono

President and Vice-Chancellor
