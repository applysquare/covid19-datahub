## Health Advisory & Campus Update

_Updated  April 21, 2020, 7:00 PM_

**To:** The Stevens Community  
 **From:** Marybeth Murphy, Vice President for Enrollment Management and Student Affairs  
 **Date:  ** April 21, 2020   
 **Subject:**   Commencement 2020: Save the Date, First in Class and More

As you know, due to COVID-19, Stevens postponed its May 2020 Commencement ceremonies. Although there is still uncertainty about holding large gatherings in the fall, we want to inform you that we have reserved **Saturday, October 17, 2020** for our 2020 Commencement at the Meadowlands Expo Center in Secaucus, NJ.

Of course, as we have done throughout this time, we will follow all guidance from the State of NJ and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the health and safety of our community. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we recommend that you wait to book any non-refundable travel until later in the summer or early fall when there is more guidance about hosting large in-person events.  We will send additional updates closer to the date of the event. For more details about each ceremony [click here](/campus-life/commencement).

I am pleased to announce the undergraduate students who are recognized as First in Class. They are **Devin Dragon, Devon Leslie, Christopher Liu, Victoria Stabile,** and **Kristen Tan.** [Click here ](https://www.stevens.edu/news/five-graduating-seniors-are-first-stevens-class-2020)for more information about these students. Congratulations!

**Commencement Speakers**

I am pleased to announce that the Commencement Speaker for the Undergraduate Ceremony is  **Giovanni Caforio, M.D.** , Chairman of the Board and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb and that **Dr. Allan E. Goodman** , President and CEO of the Institute of International Education is the speaker for the Graduate Ceremony. [ Click here](https://www.stevens.edu/campus-life/commencement/commencement-speakers) for more detailed information about our distinguished speakers.

**Ordering Academic Regalia**
