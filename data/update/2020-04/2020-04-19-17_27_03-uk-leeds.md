Supporting you over the Easter break

From the afternoon of 9 April, most University services and staff will not be available as the University closes for the Easter bank holiday. The University opens again on Wednesday 15 April and you will be able to contact your school and other services as usual then. Here’s some information about how to get the support you need while the University is closed during the Easter bank holiday. 

University Security Services

Security Services are the main point of contact for any urgent support and assistance over the Easter bank holiday weekend and continue to provide a 24 hour service across campus and residences. They are dedicated to providing students with a safe, welcoming and secure environment. If you need to contact Security Services, call 0113 343 5494 or 0113 343 2222 in an emergency. In an emergency situation, please also dial 999 to alert the emergency services first.

If you need face-to-face advice and support, you can video call the Security Services through WhatsApp on 07876 866747. If you do need to see them in person, the Security Office at 175 Woodhouse Lane( http://www.leeds.ac.uk/campusmap?location=9156 ) will still be remaining open as an essential service during this time. 

More help and advice is also available on the Security Services’ website www.leeds.ac.uk/security. 

Halls of residence support

Although Wardens and Subwardens are not on duty for the duration of the Easter holidays, you can still get help if you need it. Over the Easter weekend if you need support or assistance please contact University Security Services, or if applicable, the security team or night staff at your residence. From Wednesday 15 April you can contact Residence Life( mailto:residencelife@leeds.ac.uk ) for non-urgent support. Wardens and Subwardens will resume their duties at 8am on Saturday 25 April.

Keeping in touch with others 

We know that many of our students have returned home, whether that is in the UK or internationally. This in itself presents a challenge of staying in touch with one another as time differences and new routines can make this difficult.

Our social media team has also put together this great blog on using technology to stay social( https://medium.com/@UniversityofLeeds/eight-ways-to-stay-social-online-7033e49e03c ).

The Leeds Hardship Fund( https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10231/leeds_hardship_fund ) is available to those of you who may need financial support. We know many students are away from campus at the moment, and so you can request a form by emailing the Funding team( mailto:funding@leeds.ac.uk ). Please include your name and student ID in the email. If you are eligible to apply, you will be sent an application form by email, along with further instructions. If your financial hardship relates directly to changed circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 situation please state this clearly within the email. Details about your situation can then be provided as part of the application supporting statement. Please email the team directly if you have any questions: funding@leeds.ac.uk.

Additional financial support may be available to you through the Government( https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus ) and the LUU( https://www.luu.org.uk/student-help-support/coronavirus-covid-19-were-still-here-to-help-students/ ).
