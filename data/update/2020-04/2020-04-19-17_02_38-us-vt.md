Virginia Techâ€™s online commencement for the Class of 2020 will feature inspirational messages from notable Hokies, including Miss America 2020 Camille Schrier, legendary defensive coordinator Bud Foster, and world-renowned poet and University Distinguished Professor Nikki Giovanni.



The first-of-its-kind event on Friday, May 15, at 6:30 p.m. ET will mark an important milestone for seniors and is a chance to honor the years of dedication and hard work that brought students to graduation.

Participants will be able to watch the ceremony with family and friends near and far while sharing comments and photos with one another using an online platform. The ceremony will be available on vt.edu and will be viewable on-demand afterward.

During the ceremony, graduates will also have the opportunity to create their own experience by listening to a message from their college dean and hearing their name read. The online ceremony will be a unique way for Hokies everywhere to take part in commencement. The Corps of Cadets and ROTC programs will also be featured with an online version of their special ceremony.

The ceremony will incorporate traditional commencement staples, including congratulations from the president and provost and remarks from student speakers.

The 2020 online commencement is not what senior Hokies envisioned for their graduation ceremony. Nonetheless, Hokie Nation can gather online to recognize a special group of students who have worked hard and earned this moment to be honored and celebrated, even as COVID-19 has changed the world we are all living in.
