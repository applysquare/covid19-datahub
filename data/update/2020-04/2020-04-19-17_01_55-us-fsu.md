This message to all students has been approved by Dr. Sally McRorie, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Registering for Summer classes at FSU is a great way to get ahead on your degree and learn from our outstanding faculty members and instructors. Options to study away from campus will be more flexible than ever in Summer 2020.

In Summer 2020, FSU will be offering all courses online or remote during these sessions:

Summer A (12 weeks, May 11-July 31)

Summer B (first 6 weeks, May 11-June 19)

Summer F (first 8 weeks, May 11-July 2)

Law (8 week, May 11-July 2)

No decision has been made yet about Summer C classes.

Searching for classes

Classes will be offered “online” (a course specially designed for online learning) or “remote” (traditional classes offered through online platforms). You can now search for “remote” offerings in myFSU’s Class Search using the “Physical Location” field.

Classes will either be synchronous or asynchronous. Here’s how to tell the difference.

Classes with specific days/time listed: These are synchronous classes . The class will meet virtually at those times via Zoom or other technologies. The registration system will not allow you to enroll in remote, synchronous classes with overlapping times.
