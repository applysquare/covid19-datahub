Where possible, differentiation and APR meetings should be conducted remotely providing everyone involved is happy with the arrangements. This would also be contingent on there being appropriate resources available in the School to conduct the meeting digitally and that everyone involved is still available on the scheduled date. Where a milestone meeting is held remotely, the meeting should be conducted in compliance with the [Study Regulations for Research Degree Programmes (6. Progress).](http://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/AcademicStudentAffairs/AcademicAffairs/GeneralRegulations/StudyRegulations/StudyRegulationsforResearchDegreeProgrammes/#d.en.717767)

Where it is not possible, the meeting should be postponed.  This should be rescheduled to the next available date, in agreement with the student.  Depending on when the meeting can be rescheduled, students would be permitted to register for the next academic year, with their 2019-20 academic milestone pending.

Given the time of year, students may wish to continue with their APR meeting (digitally) to have the opportunity to complete this academic milestone before deciding to take a temporary withdrawal if they cannot progress with their research remotely.
