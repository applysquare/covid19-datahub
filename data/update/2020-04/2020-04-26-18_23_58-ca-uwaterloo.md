We know many of you have questions about the Fall 2020 Term. We do too.

But we want you to know that, whatever the situation come September, you can expect to be studying towards your degree with the University of Waterloo.

Our faculty and staff are planning to deliver the quality experience that you expect from us – whether it is in person, or at a distance.

We’ll continue to adapt to the world situation with COVID-19 so that our communities stay safe and healthy. This means that while we hope to welcome you back to campus this September, we will only do so if it’s safe.

Faculty and staff are preparing a Fall term for you that includes academically challenging courses, hands-on learning, such as labs and co-op placements, and research pathways to help you achieve your educational goals. We will be ready for you, whether that be to welcome you back to campus, or to set you up for success at a distance.

We continue to get input from all levels of government to track and respond to the pandemic. We will carry on sharing updates with you in the coming weeks and make sure you know our plan for September in plenty of time to make good plans.

We’re so proud of the way students, faculty and staff have rallied together to support each other and our community. We know it’s been a challenging period of change as we shift our programming and services — we want to thank you for making it possible.

We’ll update you as soon as we know when it’s safe to welcome you back to campus. For the most current information, please keep up-to-date on our COVID-19 website.
