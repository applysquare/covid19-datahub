**Softbound submissions:** The approved copy of a student’s softbound thesis should be uploaded electronically by the School on the student’s behalf. Students should liaise with their Supervisors or Postgraduate Office as appropriate.

**Hardbound submissions:** The final approved thesis should be uploaded electronically to Pure by the student upon completion of the Thesis Deposit Form by Supervisor and Examiner. The Deposit Form should be sent to Student Registry by the School on the student’s behalf.

Students will be expected to submit hardcopies of the final approved thesis within two weeks of the University campus re-opening to students. In cases where the student is unable to submit the hardcopies for legitimate reasons, the School should arrange to submit the hardbound thesis on the student’s behalf.
