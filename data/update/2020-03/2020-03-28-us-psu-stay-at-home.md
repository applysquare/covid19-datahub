UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on March 28 updated the [“Stay at Home” order](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-and-health-secretary-expand-stay-at-home-order-to-beaver-centre-and-washington-counties-to-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19-counties-now-total-22/) for several Pennsylvania counties that are home to Penn State campuses. Penn State campuses across the commonwealth already had practices in place that align with the governor’s new order.

Faculty and staff who can work from home should continue to do so and, in alignment with this new order, employees who perform mission-critical functions, categorized as such by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are required to report onsite as directed. Per [the guidance previously provided](https://news.psu.edu/story/612429/2020/03/20/research/penn-state-research-labs-asked-reduce-activity-march-24), limited access to laboratories will be maintained so that essential research-related activities can continue.

The health, safety and well-being of all Penn Staters and surrounding local communities remain the University’s utmost priority.

This order now impacts University Park and Beaver. Earlier this week the order was put in place for Abington, Brandywine, Great Valley [campuses](https://news.psu.edu/story/613141/2020/03/25/status-update-abington-brandywine-and-great-valley-campuses), and more recently Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Hazelton, York, Berks, New Kensington, Erie and Greater Allegheny.

This new order is specific for individuals, in addition to previous orders for businesses, to “[stay at home](https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.23.20-Stay-At-Home-Order-Guidance.pdf)” to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Penn State campuses previously moved to remote instruction and steps have been taken across the University to increase social distancing, with a vast majority of staff and faculty members telecommuting.

Pennsylvania Education Secretary Pedro Rivera has offered the following guidance on some limited exceptions: “Under Governor Wolf’s order, personnel at our postsecondary institutions in all 67 counties who are providing life-sustaining services, including, but not limited to: administration, food preparation and distribution, housing, security, information technology, building maintenance, and operations (e.g., payroll) can continue to be deemed essential and are permitted to continue their work, provided they adhere to social distancing guidelines.”

All campuses, regardless of their location, are following the governor’s orders at this time. Campus employees who have questions on the updated guidance should check with their supervisors. The University cannot predict when the current directives may change as this is a fluid situation; however, Penn State will continue to notify employees of any changes in status as appropriate.
