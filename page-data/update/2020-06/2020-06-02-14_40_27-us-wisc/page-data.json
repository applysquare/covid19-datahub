We are now embarking on a limited expansion of on-campus research, while ensuring we are following campus guidelines to minimize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>This page has important information about returning to campus research space in this first phase. Those who are approved must abide by requirements laid out to conduct research and maintain safe conditions at all times.</p>\n<p>Research will be restarted in phases, with a focus on expanding research activities while minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to our students, staff, faculty and the community. All plans for on-campus research must comply with campus and external guidelines and be an approved activity.</p>\n<p>To the greatest extent possible, research personnel should continue to work from home; in particular, all vulnerable individuals are encouraged to continue to work from home.</p>\n<p>Researchers seeking to resume their on campus research in Phase 1 must receive approval from their college dean (or designee for approval) or the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education. If a request is not approved, that research cannot commence.</p>\n<p>Researchers should be aware that depending on the situation, such as an increase in positive cases in the community or cases on campus, we may need to again quickly introduce additional restrictions to on-campus research activity. We will continue to monitor and provide guidance to our research community.</p>\n<p>Important Contacts:</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 29, 2020","title":"Research Reboot – Return to Research Phase 1","tags":null,"link":"https://research.wisc.edu/reboot-phase1/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6dee1045-f1aa-5301-b8ec-ee57061192c3"}}}
