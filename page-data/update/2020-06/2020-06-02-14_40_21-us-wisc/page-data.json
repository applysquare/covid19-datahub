This applies to programs planned through exchange agreements with International Academic Programs, Wisconsin School of Business, College of Engineering, and College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. This decision does not apply to students in other categories, such as VISP or international degree-seeking students.</p>\n<p>Several factors were considered, including expected delays for visa processing this summer, probable limitations to on-campus activities for the fall, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students worldwide. Making this decision now will allow students additional time to make other arrangements for the fall semester.</p>\n<p>Please note that this decision should not be perceived as an indicator of the status of on-campus programming at UW–Madison for the fall semester.</p>\n<p>We know this news will be disappointing for international non-degree seeking students planning to study at UW–Madison in the fall. It is disappointing for other UW–Madison students, faculty, and staff, as we all look forward to the diverse perspectives, opportunities for collaborative learning, and personal friendships that these exchanges afford. However, the health, safety, and academic success of all of our students continues to be the top priority for UW–Madison.</p>\n<p>Students and partner institutions have been notified on steps to take to join us on campus as early as spring 2021. We look forward to welcoming these students to campus in the future.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Guido Podestá</p>\n<p>Vice provost and dean, International Division</p>\n<p>Note: For information on outbound study abroad programming for fall 2020, read a recent post.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 29, 2020","title":"Inbound non-degree seeking exchanges cancelled for fall 2020 semester","tags":null,"link":"https://international.wisc.edu/inbound-non-degree-seeking-exchanges-cancelled-for-fall-2020-semester/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2825daa5-0a40-52bf-80ee-bb0c69cb4e65"}}}
