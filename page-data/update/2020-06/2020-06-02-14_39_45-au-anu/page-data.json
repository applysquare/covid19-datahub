Our goal is to have an ordered return of teaching and learning to campus, prioritising health and safety.</p>\n<p>We are focussing on getting back to a regular schedule for Semester 2 with teaching starting on Monday 27 July. Other dates will remain the same as scheduled in the university calendar.</p>\n<p>For Semester 2 the University campuses will move to Level A, open with restrictions. That means courses will be available in a hybrid model to engage and support you whether you plan to continue to study remotely or return to campus. While all courses will be available for remote study, teaching activities held on campus will be in line with social distancing and other health protocols as set out by the Australian Government. If you have any questions, please contact your course convenor or college.</p>\n<p>We have also published the timeframes for applications for rooms in residential halls for Semester 2. If you are considering returning to live on campus in a residential hall, please review the information on the accommodation web pages carefully before submitting your application.</p>\n<p>From Tuesday 2 June 2020, higher degree by research (HDR), Masters Advanced, Honours and undergraduate research or supervised project students will be able to return to do their work on campus when notified by their college or school. In addition, some coursework students will be able to return to campus to conduct laboratory, fieldwork or studio activities that have not been conducted while we have been working remotely. These activities will all take place within strict health and safety guidelines. Colleges and schools will notify you if and when it is possible for you to safely participate in these activities.</p>\n<p>I wish you all the best as you continue with your studies.</p>\n<p>Grady</p>\n<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 26, 2020","title":"Message to students - safe return of teaching and learning","tags":null,"link":"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/message-to-students-safe-return-of-teaching-and-learning"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"88d62748-b54c-59b4-987b-89ca546bbc76"}}}
