The initial information has been prepared under the careful guidance of the Chancellorâ€™s Fall 2020 Campus Readiness Task Force. Communication regarding employee return expectations and timing will come through supervisors. </p>\n<p>TCU will continue to adhere to public health authorities and guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control</a> as the plan progresses. Additional information for employees may be found <a href=\"https://hr.tcu.edu/remote-work/return-to-campus/\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>A limited number of leaders and department heads will return in Phase 1 to prepare the campus for succeeding phases and ultimately the return of students in August. All members of the TCU community should wear face coverings when in public (each employee will receive one machine washable cloth face covering). </p>\n<p>Gatherings will be limited to avoid community spread. Employees are encouraged to continue using Zoom for meetings with colleagues and others. If in-person meetings are required, physical distancing guidelines should be followed. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/covid19-datahub/coronavirus/files/Daily-Health-Self-Assessment-On-Site-Personnel.pdf\">Daily health assessments</a> should be conducted to ensure the health and safety of your family and the TCU campus. Employees should not report to work when they are sick. </p>\n<p>More details of the plan will be released prior to the start of Phase II on June 8. Each employee contributes significantly to the TCU culture and experience, and the university is grateful for their passion and dedication to the mission. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2020","title":"May 22, 2020 (3:00 PM)","tags":null,"link":"https://www.tcu.edu/coronavirus/updates.php"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"52707366-e174-5914-ac67-424c73cde150"}}}
