This is not automatic and subject to meeting certain eligibility criteria: please read the information on this page and take action if appropriate.</p>\n<p>If you are still studying and need to extend your UK visa for a longer period of time, please see the next FAQ.</p>\n<p>I am in the UK, still studying and my visa is expiring soon - can I extend it?</p>\n<p>At present, all the UKVCAS biometric centres are closed so while you will be able to make and submit an online application you will not be able to book an appointment or upload your documents. As long as you submit the online application form and pay all the visa fees before the expiry date of your current visa, however, you will be considered to have made an in-time application even though you will need to wait until the centres re-open to upload your documents and complete biometrics. This means that you should legally be allowed to be in the UK while your application is on hold; you will be expected to book a biometric appointment as soon as the centres reopen. If you are a continuing student who needs to make an application to extend your visa please get in touch with us at student-visa-advice@bristol.ac.uk to request the CAS and receive tailored advice in due course. In the meantime you can read about the Tier 4 visa requirements here . Please note that if your visa expires after 31 May 2020, we will not be able to issue the CAS at this moment. UKVI will be reviewing their guidance to sponsors in the light of rapidly changing circumstances after that date. Additionally to that, students whose leave expires between 24 January 2020 and 31 May 2020 can apply to have their visas extended to 31 May 2020 if they cannot leave the UK because of travel restrictions or self-isolation related to COVID-19. Please see the FAQ above for further information. Please note that this only applies if you have not yet left the UK.</p>\n<p>Can I go home?</p>\n<p>Yes, you can leave the UK. As long as it is possible for you continue to engage with your studies remotely your Tier 4 visa should not be affected and you should be able to resume your studies in the UK once you are able to come back. If you are unable to return to the UK for a prolonged period of time, we will look to ensure that you can continue to access online teaching and assessment where possible. If you plan to be outside the UK for more than 60 days (excluding holiday period), and this is agreed with your personal tutor or academic supervisor that you can continue your studies remotely during this time, the University may have to report a change in your study location to the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI). This is to notify them that we, as your Tier 4 sponsor, are aware that you are temporarily studying outside the UK, so that upon your return UK Border Officers do not question your absence from the country or your engagement in your studies. If this arrangement is agreed, you can contact your School or Faculty office to request that they fill in the Reporting Change in Study Location Microsoft form. We will send any important communications about your visa to both your university and your home email address, so you should make sure that your contact details are up to date. Please check that your \"home\" email address is different from your university email address and is your current email address which you can access regularly. To do this please log in at <a href=\"https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/\">https://www.bris.ac.uk/studentinfo/</a> and click on the 'update' button.</p>\n<p>I am already in the UK and am supposed to start studies at the University of Bristol soon - what should I do now?</p>\n<p>If you are already in the UK, please contact your School and Student Visa Services to see if there is a solution for you. The School should be able to establish if starting the course remotely while the University buildings remain closed would be appropriate in your case, but it is also possible that your start date will need to be delayed. Should a remote start be agreed, Student Visa Services will be able to advise you on the possibility of applying for a new visa in the UK. Please do not proceed with applying for a new visa until you have taken these steps.</p>\n<p>I need to apply for ATAS or have an outstanding ATAS application â€“ will this be affected by the outbreak?</p>\n<p>Students studying certain programmes require ATAS clearance. Please note that due to the COVID-19 outbreak the Foreign and Commonwealth Office cannot accept any new ATAS applications. If you had submitted an application before 6 April 2020, they should still process it but there may be delays. The FCO will re-open the Scheme as soon as possible and they apologise for any inconvenience caused. Please visit their ATAS webpage for further updates. If you are already in the UK and were hoping to start your UoB course soon, please note that unfortunately you will not be able to start without a valid ATAS certificate.</p>\n<p>I want to go home but have not updated / received my Police Registration certificate</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Directory of Professional Services","tags":null,"link":"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/coronavirus/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"09ad309f-7ff4-5f06-8f58-a2afe5daf52e"}}}
