Faculty and staff members are working remotely, unless they are providing essential services for the campus and the students who were unable to leave due to personal circumstances.</li>\n<li>Essential services available on campus continue to include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu <a href=\"https://www.elondining.com/menu-hours/\">here</a>), Student Health Services (hours and appointment information <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/\">here</a>), Faculty/Staff Health &#x26; Wellness Clinic (hours and appointment information <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/bft/wellness/\">here</a>), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 a.m.-midnight.</li>\n<li>Consistent with the governor’s <a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf\">stay-at-home executive order</a>, students who live on or near campus should not leave their residences except to get food, medicine or necessary supplies; exercise outdoors; to take care of others in need or do volunteer service; or to perform other essential functions outlined in the executive order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Future plans for undergraduate academic programs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Elon plans to conduct fall semester classes on campus and according to the normal schedule. Plans for fall semester study abroad and Study USA courses are also proceeding as normal.</strong> Fall semester academic program plans and schedules are subject to change, depending on the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Future updates will be posted on the university coronavirus website, <a href=\"http://www.elon.edu/coronavirus\">www.elon.edu/coronavirus</a>.</li>\n<li>Elon’s two <strong>undergraduate Summer Sessions</strong> will be held on the normal schedule, with all classes conducted online.
