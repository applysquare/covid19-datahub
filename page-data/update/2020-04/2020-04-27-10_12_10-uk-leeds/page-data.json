As this is such a large task, Euan would like to use the collective wisdom of our researchers by asking, when reading papers on COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 that show evidence of dysregulation of genes/gene sets during infection, to enter as much information into the first table of the Google Docs spreadsheet as possible (link below).\nMoreover, if you find papers where any gene expression data (NGS/Nanopore RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, Proteomics etc) is generated/used, recording this (inc the data accession codes, along the lines of GSEXXXXX or E-GEOD-XXXX) and adding these to the table below would be hugely helpful too. If you fancied joining the team we're looking for people with experience of data wrangling &#x26; quality-control of 'omics data, pathway analysis/network modelling and module detection. Anyone who contributes as part of the team or by sending data/info dysregulated genes from papers would of course be given credit.</p>\n<p>If you have any queries please contact Euan (bs14e3m@leeds.ac.uk) and Google docs spreadsheet( <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1U1ZpH_avjuDrjsJNmN4xlD7OyEkJBMKSYWUmNSh-s/edit?fbclid=IwAR3O7Jx5fZbni_3Ib-enGLN25at-rdlYM4vrpsv1gGUvYNYkSN__Q4ebtkA#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1U1ZpH_avjuDrjsJNmN4xlD7OyEkJBMKSYWUmNSh-s/edit?fbclid=IwAR3O7Jx5fZbni_3Ib-enGLN25at-rdlYM4vrpsv1gGUvYNYkSN__Q4ebtkA#gid=0</a> ).</p>\n<p>Doing Good Leeds   Voluntary Action Leeds are co-ordinating the city-wide volunteering effort to respond to the Coronavirus situation, and all of the activity and resources are listed on the Doing Good Leeds site.
