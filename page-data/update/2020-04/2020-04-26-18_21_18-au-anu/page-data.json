But I would like to take the time to address some of the concerns and misinformation that has been circulating.</p>\n<p>We have conducted preliminary privacy and security assessments. We have updated the security assessment following direct conversations with Proctorio, and we have completed the privacy assessment, which has been published today. We are satisfied with the security settings of Proctorio, and we are satisfied with the privacy measures in place for its use.</p>\n<p>Regarding privacy, the only people able to see any recordings of your exams are you and your teacher. Adherence to the University's privacy policy is written into a teacher's employment contract.</p>\n<p>For many of you, completing exams is imperative to completing or continuing your studies. We are all in a new and unfamiliar situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. The University is doing all it can to minimise disruption to your studies. You have a part to play in that too.</p>\n<p>We will be trialling Proctorio in a few weeks to test its suitability for various courses and will provide an update once those tests are completed.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we strongly encourage you to focus on your studies as exams and assessment periods are fast approaching.</p>\n<p>Grady</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 20, 2020","title":"Update from Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic)â€“ 17 April 2020","tags":null,"link":"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/update-from-deputy-vice-chancellor-academic%E2%80%93-17-april-2020"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"44c456f8-2624-586b-b4cb-8f52f7af197f"}}}
