We are keenly aware that accommodations, reservations and travel arrangements will need to be made, and we intend to give you at least two months’ notice between the time of the announcement and the chosen date.</p>\n<p>We hope to provide this information and associated details in the second half of May, as we learn more from New York state government and health officials. However, with the current level of uncertainty, we may need to postpone our decision even further.</p>\n<p>I wish this message included more information, but I know you needed an update and this is the best we can do at this time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Harvey Stenger</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>For more information and updates, continue to visit the University's COVID-19 website.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 20, 2020","title":null,"tags":null,"link":"https://www.binghamton.edu/president/statements/2020-04-20.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8449fe39-195c-56aa-b3bd-b0688ae2ffd8"}}}
