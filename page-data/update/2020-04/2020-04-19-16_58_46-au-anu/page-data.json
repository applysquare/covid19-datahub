After the teaching pause, classes will resume on Monday 30 March, with the two-week mid-semester break occurring as planned (6-17 April). Semester 1 will be extended by one week to allow for the teaching pause, and the timing at the end of the semester and exam period will be adjusted. The adjusted dates are outlined below.

Refer to the 2020 Key Dates - Remote Participation webpage to understand how changes to census date apply to you.</p>\n<p>We recognise that this semester has been very disrupted for you and we're modifying the way we hold our mid-semester and end of semester exams. Students have raised some concerns about the proposed tool Proctorio for remote examinations. You can find guidance that addresses these concerns here. Will my grades be affected by the switch to remote learning? The University's Academic Board has recommended that we continue to use the standard mark and grade approach we currently use. However, each student may request, in writing to the Registrar after the release of results, that their final grade for Semester 1 2020, in one or more courses for the semester, be recorded on their transcript as either CRS (course requirements satisfied) or NCN (not completed/fail). The Vice-Chancellor has approved this recommendation. Will my mid-semester and/or end of semester exams proceed if we are finishing this semester by remote/online participation? As we have shifted all classes to remote/online participation, we won't be holding centrally timetabled and invigilated in-person mid-semester and end of semester exams. I was supposed to complete a mid-semester or end of semester exam as part of my course. How will I complete this assessment? We're working with your course convenor(s) to adapt all assessments so they can be completed remotely and they'll be in touch with you to provide an update on assessment for the remainder of the semester. Many existing forms of online assessment tools will be used including quizzes, Turnitin, take-home exams and essays and discussion post ratings. We are implementing remote sitting of exams through a secure online tool.</p>\n<p>Who do I contact about my assessment?
