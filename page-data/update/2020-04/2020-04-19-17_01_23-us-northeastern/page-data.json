As each of you know, these are extraordinary times that require additional flexibility on the part of the university. Some students and families are enduring remarkable hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, we will allow undergraduate students to take some or all courses pass/fail this semester. Summer grading will return to the normal rules.</p>\n<p>Policy (effective immediately) : Undergraduate students may—but are not required to—change some or all classes to pass/fail any time before midnight on the last day of classes, April 14, 2020. Instructions for how to petition for pass/fail can be found on the Registrar’s website: <a href=\"https://registrar.northeastern.edu/\">https://registrar.northeastern.edu/</a></p>\n<p>Students should consult with their academic advisors if they have questions about the implications of opting for pass/fail grading.</p>\n<p>Best wishes for a safe and healthy conclusion of the semester.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>James C.
