Therefore, reduced campus operations will continue through that date, pending possible future extensions. Additionally, as previously announced, remote instruction will continue through at least the end of Summer Session A.</p>\n<p>As shared in a campuswide message on March 19, the campus is operating much like it does during annual winter closure, with only essential services in effect. Please visit the UCLA Administration website for the latest information about the availability of campus services during the safer at home orders.</p>\n<p>In addition to the extension, the county’s updated order requires that all essential businesses, including universities, develop protocols for maintaining physical distance (PDF) in facilities that are frequented by the public and employees. The order also requires that everyone wear cloth face coverings when visiting essential businesses, and it requires employees to wear cloth face coverings if they work in areas where they will be in contact with others for 10 minutes or more in areas where a distance of 6 feet or more cannot be maintained. Exceptions include individuals performing roles that require more prescriptive personal protective equipment, such as first responders and those in health care and research labs. We expect faculty, staff and students to comply with these emergency measures.</p>\n<p>UCLA is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff who are working on campus in close quarters (at a distance of 6 feet or less for 10 minutes or more) and for students living in on-campus housing. Employees who need cloth facing coverings should speak with their department managers; managers are asked to please fill out this Cloth Face Covering Request Form for their teams. For students living on the Hill, a communication will be sent from Housing on when and where these masks will be available, once they have been received. This UCLA COVID-19 Response flier (PDF) provides additional helpful information for staff and students on campus.</p>\n<p>We know that adapting to this new way of life over the past few weeks has been challenging, as so many of us are still adjusting to remote teaching, learning and working. Our nurses and doctors, residents and fellows, maintenance workers and support staff on campus are also facing daunting challenges. Please know that your resilience and commitment to UCLA’s mission is a source of motivation for your fellow Bruins.</p>\n<p>As always, UCLA is fully committed to the health and well-being of every member of the campus community. We will be in touch with additional updates, and we are posting new information regularly on UCLA’s COVID-19 information page and Bruins Safe Online.</p>\n<p>Please continue to take good care of yourselves and each other.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Michael J.
