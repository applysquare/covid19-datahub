We also want to express our gratitude for the many ways you continue to show your commitment to this community and to one another.</p>\n<p>Through all of the recent changes to your CMU experience, you have maintained a positive outlook and displayed remarkable unity, creativity, and perseverance. You have mobilized to respond to the current crisis, including working with faculty to develop impactful research proposals and engaging in relief efforts. And you have shown incredible ingenuity in building connections to one another. Virtual Carnival is just the latest example, but there have been so many more; from memes to Tik Tok videos to the virtual Fence, you have made the best of this unexpected situation. Thank you for making us all smile.</p>\n<p>Throughout this challenging time, our values remain a vital touchstone, including empathy, inclusion, and respect. We must continue to model these ideals and demonstrate the power of a community that is strong in the face of challenges, undeterred by fear and, above all, compassionate in its embrace of one another. Especially at a time when xenophobia is on the rise, we must never falter in our commitment to stand up against hate, and bigotry in any form. Remember: we are all in this together.</p>\n<p>We want to take this opportunity to remind any student experiencing unexpected financial hardship as a result of the pandemic that there are resources to support you. The CMU Alumni Association has collaborated with the Office of the Dean of Students and student leadership to set up a Tartan Emergency Support Fund to help students meet unforeseen expenses needing immediate assistance, such as travel, moving costs, and living expenses. Over 1,000 alumni, parents, faculty, staff, student government and organizations, and friends of the university have contributed more than $300,000 to this fund and other COVID-related response initiatives. We encourage anyone who needs assistance to reach out to the university for support.</p>\n<p>While the overwhelming speed and scope of the pandemic has led to some challenging moments, at many times over the past several weeks, we have also been overcome with pride in this communityâ€™s indefatigable spirit. We have never been prouder to be Tartans and we are confident that we will get through this together and emerge stronger on the other side.</p>\n<p>Until we can see each other again, stay safe and be well,</p>\n<p>Farnam Jahanian</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Gina Casalegno</p>\n<p>Dean of Students and Vice President for Student Affairs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"CMU-Alert Emergency Notification System","tags":null,"link":"https://www.cmu.edu/alert/coronavirus/communications/apr-20a-2020.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5d904ecc-584a-59e2-a96a-36bf81ac258c"}}}
