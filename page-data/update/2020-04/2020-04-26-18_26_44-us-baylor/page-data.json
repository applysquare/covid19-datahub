If you have employees with the skill set and ability to work on projects, that may be an option.</p>\n<p>This is also a great time for staff to hone their skills through online training. Baylor provides free online training to their faculty and staff through LinkedIn Learning as well as RightNow Media at Work. Get set up on LinkedIn Learning if you do not already have access. As a manager, you may browse the learning libraries and assign specific training courses to an employee that would enhance their skills related to their position.</p>\n<p>If there is a time where work is simply not available, then employees should utilize the paid leave benefits through the Caregiver Leave Policy and their Vacation accruals. Please complete the Caregiver Leave Form, indicate the \"other\" option, and email the form to askhr@baylor.edu and copy your supervisor on the email. HR will automatically approve the request. Non-exempt staff will notate the use of this leave by choosing the caregiver leave option on your timecard within BearWeb. Exempt staff will track the use of this leave through their monthly tracking form turned into their department's leave coordinator. The amount of leave available for Caregiver Leave is based on full-time equivalent (FTE) (i.e., a part-time employee normally scheduled for 20 hours per week will have 80 hours of caregiver leave as opposed to a full-time employee scheduled to work 40 hours per week will have 160 hours of caregiver leave). Employees cannot use paid leave benefits to extend beyond their normally scheduled hours per week.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","tags":null,"link":"https://www.baylor.edu/coronavirus/index.php?id=967403#faq_heading_5417"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"26355abf-7d6b-5aa1-bc0d-50524856347d"}}}
