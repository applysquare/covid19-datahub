In the extensive outreach the university conducted as part of the comprehensive review of mental health, we repeatedly heard from students that pre-enrollment is a stressful process. We do not want to compound student stress by proceeding with pre-enrollment at a time when you may still feel disoriented, have not had a chance to reconnect with your advisors, and/or do not yet have a good sense for your academic performance in your courses this semester.</p>\n<p>Therefore, pre-enrollment will be delayed until after the semester is complete and grades have been posted to academic transcripts. Please note that due to the revisions that were made to the Spring 2020 academic calendar for undergraduates and to accommodate faculty need for extra time to grade new or revised assignments, the deadline for faculty to submit final grades has been extended to June 10. Undergraduate pre-enrollment for Fall 2020 classes will begin in mid- to late-June rather than April 27 as originally planned. Once exact dates have been set, we will communicate them to all undergraduate students and academic advisors.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please reach out to your college advising office.</p>\n<p>With all best wishes from Ithaca,</p>\n<p>Lisa Nishii</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 20, 2020","title":"Coronavirus Updates","tags":null,"link":"https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/statements-news/20200420-students-fall-enrollment.cfm"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"26fb473b-9de9-5052-9f39-5ce8bcad907d"}}}
