We know that many of you have concerns about the summer. While some employers continue to offer remote work—including Penn’s summer work-study program—various other opportunities are no longer available, leaving undergraduate students and their families who are eligible for need-based financial aid without essential summer income that they had been anticipating.</p>\n<p>To help mitigate the loss of this expected income, Penn will provide all undergraduate students whose financial aid packages include a summer savings expectation with a supplemental COVID-19 Summer Savings Grant for the 2020-2021 academic year. This increase in financial aid applies to both incoming and returning aided undergraduate students and will replace the entire amount of a student’s summer savings expectation.</p>\n<p>Aided undergraduate students do not have to take any additional steps beyond completing their standard financial aid application to receive this increased funding in their 2020-2021 packages. Eligible students will see additional grant funding reflected on their award for next year.</p>\n<p>Penn is one of the few institutions that can continue to provide undergraduate students with grant-based financial aid. While also working to find ways to balance our budget, we are committed to adjusting our practices to meet this moment and provide additional support wherever possible.</p>\n<p>We send our best wishes to each of you and your families. Please stay safe and well.</p>\n<p>Amy Gutmann, President</p>\n<p>Wendell Pritchett, Provost</p>\n<p>MaryFrances McCourt, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"April 21, 2020 - A Message to Undergraduate Students Regarding Summer Savings Grants","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/content/april-21-2020-message-undergraduate-students-regarding-summer-savings-grants"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"173f7717-e2ae-5b1a-b701-5fcad1b51bcd"}}}
