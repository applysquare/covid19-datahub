In an effort to keep the University community continuously informed, we write to provide you with an update regarding summer term course delivery and additional University resources.  </p>\n<p> <strong>SUMMER AND FALL TERMS</strong><br>\nRegistration for the summer and fall terms opened this week. To prioritize safety and health, the University will conduct summer sessions that begin in May online, including Summer A and Summer C. Select courses in Summer C may transition to on-campus instruction later in the summer if it is deemed safe to do so.  </p>\n<p>We are happy to announce that additional courses have been added to the summer schedule to ensure we are offering courses students need and want. The Registrar’s office worked jointly with the academic deans to identify courses most popular among students, as well as courses needed for academic progress. Periodically, the Registrar’s office will send an email to students to introduce newly offered courses, and we encourage you to look for those emails.  </p>\n<p>At present, there are no changes to the fall semester schedule or course offerings. We will continue to evaluate the public health emergency, working closely with government and public health agencies, to determine if changes to the academic calendar or manner of course delivery are needed. Any changes will be communicated directly to the University community.  </p>\n<p>As always, students are strongly encouraged to discuss their course selections with their academic advisors.  </p>\n<p> <strong>LEARNING RESOURCES</strong><br>\nThe University has created additional support for remote technologies that allow faculty and students to continue their teaching and learning activities.
