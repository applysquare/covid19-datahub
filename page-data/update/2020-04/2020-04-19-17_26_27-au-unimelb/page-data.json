Staff were also advised at the time that if existing participation requirements were essential components of the teaching and learning — that is, necessary for meeting the intended learning outcomes — alternate means of assessment would need to be explored where practicable and published in the LMS on or before 17 April 2020.</p>\n<p>With the move now to a full virtual campus, it may be appropriate in some subjects for there to be expectations or requirements for participation and engagement in  <em>asynchronous</em> activities. Asynchronous participation and engagement offers students flexibility across time zones and provides protection against any technical issues that might occur from time to time in synchronous settings.</p>\n<p>Participation and engagement requirements for  <em>synchronous</em> classroom activities should be waived in most circumstances, though there may be situations in which these requirements are necessary for meeting the intended learning outcomes. Subject coordinators will advise you.
