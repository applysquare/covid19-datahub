Please visit the site if you have questions.</p>\n<p>Using Face Masks on Campus</p>\n<p>Both the CDC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are currently recommending that people wear masks in public settings to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, in addition to following other social-distancing measures like maintaining at least 6 feet between yourself and others.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff on campus must wear a face mask when out in public or near other people during work hours. Students need to do the same whenever they leave their private residences on campus, especially when they travel to places where it may be difficult to maintain social distancing. This includes wearing masks at dining centers, where Tufts Dining employees are putting their own health at risk in order to serve other members of the Tufts community.</p>\n<p>Cloth face masks are recommended; they can be fashioned from scarves, bandanas, T-shirts, and other household items. Dust masks may also be used. Make sure your mask:</p>\n<p>Fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face</p>\n<p>Is secured with ties or ear loops</p>\n<p>Includes multiple layers of fabric</p>\n<p>Allows for breathing without restriction</p>\n<p>Can be able to be laundered and machine dried daily, or after each use, without damage or change to shape</p>\n<p>Your Health</p>\n<p>If you are concerned that you may have been exposed to the coronavirus, please contact your doctor for guidance. If you have had a positive COVID-19 test, please immediately notify covid19@tufts.edu so we can communicate with others who may have been exposed. If you have other questions or concerns, please contact the crisis communications center, which covers all campuses, at covid19@tufts.edu</p>\n<p>As noted above, a reminder for anyone who needs to be on campus: following CDC recommendations, face masks are required for those on all campuses at Tufts.</p>\n<p>Tisch College has compiled a list of “ Social Emotional, Civic Learning &#x26; Mindfulness Resources .” It includes articles, organizations, and webinars that aim to promote emotional resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. These resources have been curated and reviewed by Deborah Donahue-Keegan of the Department of Education, who is also associate director of the Tisch College Initiative on Social Emotional Learning and Civic Engagement. This resource list will be continually updated in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>All AS&#x26;E Summer Classes Will Be Virtual</p>\n<p>All 2020 summer classes in the School of Arts and Sciences, including GSAS and SMFA, and in the School of Engineering, will be offered in an exclusively virtual format. Also, for undergraduates, AS&#x26;E has adjusted restrictions around online courses being used towards undergraduate degree requirements, so online and virtual undergraduate Tufts courses completed in summer 2020 will not be counted toward the current limit of online courses applied toward graduation. You can find this policy adjustment here</p>\n<p>Updates from Tisch Library</p>\n<p>We are happy to report that HathiTrust Digital Library has now made a substantial portion of Tisch Library’s print collection available in ebook format.

The university has never taken such extraordinary actions in its history.
