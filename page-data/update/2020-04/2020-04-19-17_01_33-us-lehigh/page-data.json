We continue to follow CDC guidelines, as well as the advice of Lehigh’s health professionals, as we proceed with planning for future months. We anticipate that we will need to maintain the practice of social distancing and abide by Governor Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order for Pennsylvania well into the summer.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we have decided to cancel all on-campus summer programs through the end of July. This includes events and activities on all three of Lehigh’s campuses: Packer, Goodman and Mountaintop. Individual programs will be providing participants with additional details in the days to come. Whether and how programs may be on campus after the end of July will depend on guidance from state and federal authorities as well as our own judgment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that this will disappoint many and present hardships for some, but just as we prioritize the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, we must also safeguard the health and safety of others who may have planned to spend time on our campus this summer. We look forward to an eventual return to the in-person events and activities that countless members of our wider Lehigh family enjoy each summer.</p>\n<p>Until then, we wish you good health.</p>\n<p>Patrick Farrell, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2020","title":"4.14.20: Update on On-Campus Summer Programs","tags":null,"link":"https://www2.lehigh.edu/news/41420-update-on-on-campus-summer-programs"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff503f02-c958-5068-8c2f-9d404e5698a5"}}}
