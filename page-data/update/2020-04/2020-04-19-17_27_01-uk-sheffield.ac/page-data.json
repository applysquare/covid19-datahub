Summative assessments must be completed for the remainder of this academic year in order for you to finish your degree and can only have a positive impact on your overall mark or degree class.</p>\n<p>Working through the processes required to put this safety net in place across the wide range of our degree programmes is going to be a complex task. There may also be some circumstances where we cannot apply this no detriment approach to programmes which are subject to professional regulations. Please bear with us as we work through the specific details.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"What is the Universityâ€™s safety net policy for exams and assessments?","tags":null,"link":"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"15cf3e03-2ed1-5e55-b7ec-946791090cc0"}}}
