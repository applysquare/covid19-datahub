We are writing to provide you with an important update on our registration hold policy.</p>\n<p>In light of the difficult circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in support of our commitment to caring for the GW community, effective April 16 all students currently registered for the spring 2020 semester will be able to register for classes as scheduled during the summer and fall 2020 registration cycles, regardless of your current account balance.</p>\n<p>Please note that this change in policy applies to summer and fall registration only, and while your account may still display a hold, it will not prevent you from registering. Our current policy is in effect for transcript and diploma requests.</p>\n<p>As we continue to find ways to support you and your families through these challenging times where safety must take priority, we also remain focused on your wellbeing and academic success.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact our team at Student Financial and Registration Services at 202-994-7350 or [email protected].</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>M.
