Faculty should not use this time to require additional work or assignments from students.</p>\n<p>Study Days will now be held on Monday, May 4, and Tuesday, May 5.</p>\n<p>Final Exams will now be held two days later, beginning Wednesday, May 6, and continuing through Thursday, May 14.</p>\n<p>All grades for May degree recipients are now due May 17, not May 10 as in the previously published calendar.</p>\n<p>The official degree conferral date for May will now be May 24, not May 17.</p>\n<p>When students have made the necessary administrative arrangements with faculty and academic offices to take an incomplete in a class, the due date for submission of the work has been extended from Monday, June 15, to Tuesday, June 30.</p>\n<p>Your school deans, the registrar and academic advisors can provide more details on these changes and answer any further questions you may have on this.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Lisa</p>\n<p>Lisa M.
