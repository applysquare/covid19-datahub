In those instances, courses may have to be postponed or redesigned. For classes that cannot be accommodated online, further information will be issued through our Faculties.</p>\n<p>As we continue to navigate the challenges associated with COVID-19, we are actively planning for how we might teach in the Fall semester. We appreciate that many of our students, faculty and staff will have questions about teaching and learning as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>We also understand this is a challenging time for faculty members, who may need to plan ahead for any changes in how they deliver their courses. We will provide updates as soon as we can. As a reminder, support and resources are available at <a href=\"https://keepteaching.ubc.ca/\">https://keepteaching.ubc.ca/</a> and <a href=\"https://ctl.ok.ubc.ca/\">https://ctl.ok.ubc.ca/</a>.</p>\n<p>We will do our best to update you as the situation evolves.
