Therefore, unless you are told otherwise by your department, wherever possible assessments which replace on-campus examinations will normally have an extended submission window. This is designed to enable you to manage your assessment workload, including where you have multiple deadlines, and to deal with a range of personal and domestic challenges you may be encountering at this time.</p>\n<p>This means that most students will not need to make a submission for extenuating circumstances as these will be dealt with automatically. However, some students will sadly face additional difficulties in this period in addition to the disruption generally experienced by the COVID-19 outbreak. If this applies to you, please submit for extenuating circumstances in the usual way and this will be considered by Boards of Examiners as normal. For illness- and bereavement-related extenuating circumstances, the usual requirement for evidence will be waived during this period.</p>\n<p>All students should expect to receive their exam timetables by the end of April.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 22, 2020","title":"General information for students","tags":null,"link":"https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/coronavirus-advice-and-guidance/students/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fcf75a75-6d62-5bd1-ac69-755cb42b945e"}}}
