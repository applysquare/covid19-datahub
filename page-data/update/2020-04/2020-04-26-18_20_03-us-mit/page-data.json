I want to take a few moments to let you know that you’re in my thoughts and to remind you that now, more than ever, it is important to focus on self-care, relations with others, and a sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>Many resources available to you on campus—such as S3, GradSupport, Disability and Access Services, and Student Mental Health and Counseling Services—are now available virtually. I also want you to know about other, informal supports that you can access just about any time:</p>\n<p>Please know that you can always reach out to me and share your thoughts or ask a question. I am also working on some events that will allow us to connect virtually soon. Until then, we’re sending a lot of MIT love and support your way.</p>\n<p>Take care,</p>\n<p>Suzy</p>\n<p>Suzy Nelson</p>\n<p>Vice President and Dean for Student Life</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Thinking of you: A letter to students from the Dean for Student Life","tags":null,"link":"https://covid19.mit.edu/thinking-of-you-letter-to-students"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b7e77aa6-9d6b-5abe-8db1-69e27a45ba01"}}}
