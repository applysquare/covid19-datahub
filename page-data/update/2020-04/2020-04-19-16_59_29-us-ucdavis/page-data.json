In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.”</p>\n<p>The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus — the flu.</p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, “person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.”</p>\n<p>On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a “very high threat” travel destination for university affiliates.</p>\n<p>Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County’s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident — a man — had tested positive for the novel — or new — coronavirus.

The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”</p>\n<p>He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.</p>\n<p>“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.</p>\n<p>“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”</p>\n<p>Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”</p>\n<p>He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.</p>\n<p>“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”</p>\n<p>Follow Dateline UC Davis on Twitter.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2020","title":"Coronavirus: Working Remotely, Beyond April 7","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/updates#Beyond"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2743adff-e74a-57c7-9a8a-7955f5dc4bdd"}}}
