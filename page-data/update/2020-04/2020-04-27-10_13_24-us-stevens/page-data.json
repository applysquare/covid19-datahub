Although there is still uncertainty about holding large gatherings in the fall, we want to inform you that we have reserved <strong>Saturday, October 17, 2020</strong> for our 2020 Commencement at the Meadowlands Expo Center in Secaucus, NJ.</p>\n<p>Of course, as we have done throughout this time, we will follow all guidance from the State of NJ and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the health and safety of our community. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we recommend that you wait to book any non-refundable travel until later in the summer or early fall when there is more guidance about hosting large in-person events.  We will send additional updates closer to the date of the event.
