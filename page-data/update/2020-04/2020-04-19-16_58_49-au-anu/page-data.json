But, if your Year 12 results are better than your Year 11 results, we will consider them instead.</p>\n<p>These improvements build on our sector-leading admissions process-which consider a student's all-round character, including community engagement and leadership, alongside Year 11 and ATAR results.You can apply now until 25 May. We will be making offers in August - giving you more certainty and time to plan for one of the biggest decisions of your life; where to study at university.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Information for prospective students","tags":null,"link":"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/information-for-prospective-students"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a6bc6ab-279b-58ec-8163-a6792d7cf273"}}}
