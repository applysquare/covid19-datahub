Members of our SMU community continue to show creativity and innovation in their teaching, learning and working as we face the challenges of COVID-19. In addition to making the most of online instruction, our faculty members are sharing their expertise as thought leaders. Law students have found creative ways to support fellow students seeking internships at nonprofits, and staff continue to support all of us in our endeavors. I commend each of you for the ways that you are demonstrating resilience during this crisis.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples that you might find of interest:</p>\n<p>We are turning our attention to assessing the financial impact this pandemic will have on our SMU community. We are evaluating various scenarios coming out of the stay-at-home restrictions and the financial implications thereof to share with our governing board in early May. We are exploring every aspect of our operations to reduce expenses while mitigating impacts to the extent possible on our students, staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>In particular, our students are the most vulnerable. Many have experienced loss of income and are having to consider if they are able to return to the Hilltop. Many of our recently admitted students are also having to reexamine their plans to go to college. We are planning an appeal in the coming weeks to help these students pursue their goals of graduating from SMU.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you do for SMU and for sharing examples of the resourceful ways the SMU community is supporting the North Texas community, SMU students and colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please continue to share your stories with news@smu.edu. And keep up the important work you do on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>R. Gerald Turner</p>\n<p>President</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 15, 2020","title":"SMU keeps going – volume 2 – Coronavirus (COVID-19)","tags":null,"link":"https://blog.smu.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/2020/04/15/smu-takes-action/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"051df39e-4b38-556a-902e-27ed472b8f7d"}}}
