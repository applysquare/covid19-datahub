We have also:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Made it easier to defer   **<br>\nThe extension, deferral and exceptional circumstances policy has been updated for 2020 to allow you defer online without needing to provide evidence, with no detriment to you.  </li>\n<li>**Given exam boards greater discretion when making final classification decisions   **<br>\nExam boards will have the opportunity to exercise discretion for students at the time of making final classification decisions to account for COVID-19 related disruptions.   </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall marks will be reviewed at the time of marking, with this year’s events very much in mind and with compassion. This will be without the need for students to submit additional Exceptional Circumstance requests related, for example, to the general impact of changes to assessment mode or the wider impact on everyone of C-19, and regardless of whether students are a finalist this year, or in future years.   </p>\n<p>Students should however continue to use the <a href=\"https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/services/assets/documents/Student-guidance-Extensions-Deferrals-and-ECs.pdf\">Exceptional Circumstances</a> process to report unforeseen circumstances that occurred at the time of the assessment that had a significant detrimental impact on their individual performance.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 23, 2020","title":"How is LSE ensuring no student is at detriment in the assessment period?","tags":null,"link":"https://info.lse.ac.uk/coronavirus-response/assessment-faqs"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff6cf81d-d1fe-58db-81f2-28938c596559"}}}
