Boards of Examiners, who decide your course and programme results, will be given detailed information about the impact on each of your courses of both Covid-19 and the recent industrial action to help them to make decisions in your best interests.</p>\n<p>Please do not submit a special circumstances request about the general impact of Covid-19 or industrial action, since Boards of Examiners will already be taking account of this. “General impact” means things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic;</li>\n<li>Reduced contact with relatives and friends;</li>\n<li>Lack of access to physical resources, e.g. library materials;</li>\n<li>Cancellation of classes;</li>\n<li>Reduced access to supervision/academic advice on your assessments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should submit a special circumstances request if you have experienced a unique, significant impact due to Covid-19, or the industrial action. For example, this might be because you have:             </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Been ill with Covid-19;</li>\n<li>Experienced the exacerbation of an existing health condition due to the pandemic situation or related to the impact of industrial action;</li>\n<li>Experienced the death or serious illness of someone close to you; </li>\n<li>Taken on exceptional caring responsibilities due to Covid-19;</li>\n<li>Been required to carry out more paid work than usual, as a “key worker” (e.g. in healthcare, retail, delivery);</li>\n<li>Experienced significant and prolonged problems with access to teaching and learning materials, e.g. due to connectivity, power, or equipment issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Providing this additional information will help your Board of Examiners to decide what action to take in your best interest.</p>\n<p>You can also submit a special circumstances request as usual if your assessments – especially those from earlier in the Semester – have been affected by other circumstances beyond your control. Information about what would normally qualify as special circumstances is <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/assessment/special-circumstances\">available on our website</a>. </p>\n<p>If you have been affected by special circumstances, you should submit information in writing. You should do this through the normal route in your School.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 23, 2020","title":"Do I need to submit a special circumstances request if my final assessments have been affected by Covid-19?
