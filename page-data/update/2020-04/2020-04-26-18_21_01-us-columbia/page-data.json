This will be made available to over 1,000 doctoral students whose schools typically appoint them on a nine-month basis. These funds are available to assist with a range of challenges and contingencies that our students are facing during the COVID-19 emergency.</p>\n<p>$1,500 will be distributed to all eligible students before June 1; no application is required. Students may apply for a second disbursement of $1,500 if they do not have summer employment at the University. Application instructions will be forthcoming from the schools. The second disbursement will be paid by the end of July.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Update From the University for PhD Candidates on 9-Month Appointments","tags":null,"link":"https://covid19.columbia.edu/news/update-university-phd-candidates-9-month-appointments"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"63e32fcb-ec44-5194-8657-99381610123c"}}}
