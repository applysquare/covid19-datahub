For the avoidance of doubt, a student’s entry WAM, in this context, is the WAM presented by the student to meet the selection resolution for that program, not the minimum WAM required for selection into the program. This applies to students who have commenced their Honours year in the first semester 2020.</li>\n<li>\n<p>All subject scores will be recorded on the transcript. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where the result does not contribute to the WAM, it will be recorded against a new code. This code identifies subjects excluded from the WAM because of COVID-19.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At the conclusion of their studies, students can request that all results recorded against the COVID-19 code be included in the WAM calculation. Any such subjects will then be coded as per usual practice.</li>\n<li>The revised WAM calculation does not apply to any subjects in Higher Degrees by Research.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The University believes this decision is in the best interests of all our students. We will continue to engage with our students as we navigate these challenging times together.</p>\n<p>At the same time, our focus remains firmly on continuing to deliver the highest quality education experience and upholding the integrity of our academic programs. We thank all students for their commitment to this.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 23, 2020","title":"Weighted Average Mark (WAM)","tags":null,"link":"https://students.unimelb.edu.au/student-support/coronavirus/information-for-all-students"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b4dd0117-501d-519b-ab71-e52b75c5a446"}}}
