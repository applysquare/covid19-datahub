Details will be announced soon, and you will also hear from your school/college about other virtual activities and events to commemorate your years at UMass.</p>\n<p>This online event on the day that commencement would have occurred is not a substitute for an on-campus celebration, which will still take place sometime after restrictions on large gatherings are lifted. In March, we promised that we would work on alternative plans for commencement and we asked for your input and ideas. The commencement team received many thoughtful and creative proposals from students, parents and other members of the campus community. We thank you for your inspiration and feedback, and we continue to seek additional feedback regarding how and when to celebrate 2020 commencement on campus.</p>\n<p>Of course, you will need your regalia for both the virtual and in-person celebrations. We are thrilled that we are able to offer you your caps, gowns, and tassel at no charge through our partner, Jostens. Jostens will guarantee delivery by May 8 for all orders placed by April 17, 2020. To order, please visit the Jostens website. To ensure accuracy, you’ll be asked for your height and major when you place your order. Graduates earning dual or triple degrees should order online and send an email to commencement@umass.edu to receive your additional tassels.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, be on the lookout for opportunities to share memories and your favorite things about UMass Amherst via social media to help us build an online yearbook for the Class of 2020! And when you get your cap and gown, send us a picture!</p>\n<p>We miss you! We look forward to celebrating with you virtually in May – and in person later on.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Celebrating the Class of 2020","tags":null,"link":"https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/news/celebrating-class-2020"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a8b479b5-bf3a-58d3-8676-e9c3887e4256"}}}
