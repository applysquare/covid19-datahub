Our 2020 graduates have worked hard for this milestone and deserve the opportunity to mark this day, pausing to recognize all they have achieved.</p>\n<p>As promised in my message last week, I am writing today to share with you specific details about how degrees will be conferred:</p>\n<p>First, I call to your attention a new landing page that has been created for information on May activities celebrating the Class of 2020. The page will host our May degree conferral, and you can find additional information at syracuse.edu/academics/commencement/.</p>\n<p>This landing page will serve as the host site for a virtual degree conferral, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Sunday, May 10.</p>\n<p>The virtual degree conferral will include brief remarks from myself, Interim Vice Chancellor and Provost John Liu and Chair of the Board of Trustees Kathy Walters, as well as a special performance of our Alma Mater.</p>\n<p>Planning is underway for a fall Commencement, school/college convocations and other Commencement-related activities. In the meantime, recognizing a virtual degree conferral ceremony is no replacement for a full-fledged Commencement, we look forward to celebrating this important day with our graduates, their families, friends and loved ones.</p>\n<p>I will continue to share updates as we work to plan an unforgettable fall Commencement.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Chancellor Kent Syverud</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2020","title":"Degree Conferral for 2020 Graduating Students","tags":null,"link":"https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/04/13/degree-conferral-for-2020-graduating-students/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"01130551-3246-5cda-aba6-b6c97b006edf"}}}
