It’s an opportunity to welcome our new class to the campus community as they prepare for their academic careers at UC Riverside. This year, with the uncertainty of COVID-19, we have made the decision to move to a remote orientation program for our incoming first-year and transfer students. Today’s decision will allow us to work with our academic partners and campus departments to provide the most robust and informative program as possible. We will be working closely with all of our campus partners in the upcoming weeks to accommodate for the online program.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please visit our website at <a href=\"https://orientation.ucr.edu\">https://orientation.ucr.edu</a> or send us an email at orientation@ucr.edu. We will continue to share programmatic updates. We look forward to welcoming our new class of Highlanders.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your support and flexibility during this time. Go Highlanders!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Heather Correa – Coordinator for New Student Programs</p>\n<p>Kerri Soscia – Advisor for New Student Programs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 15, 2020","title":"Highlander Orientation to be done remotely","tags":null,"link":"https://insideucr.ucr.edu/announcements/2020/04/15/highlander-orientation-be-done-remotely"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a0f02bfe-f0c6-5a76-b34c-67cd656668e7"}}}
