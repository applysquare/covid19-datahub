It was my hope that we would be able to allow these programs to go forward, but given the continued uncertainty regarding the official end of the stay-at-home order and the recent announcement that all Pennsylvania K-12 schools would remain closed for the remainder of the academic year, we have decided to cancel all of the scheduled on-campus conferences and camps this summer.</p>\n<p>Please know how grateful I am for your continued patience and resilience during this difficult time. I will continue to provide updates as decisions are made and as new information becomes available</p>\n<p>I hope you all had a nice Passover and Easter, even though your celebration was likely very different than in years past. While we continue to be separated as a University community, it was encouraging to hear that more than 11,000 individual viewers, with likely more in each household, tuned in to Easter Sunday Mass with me and my fellow Augustinians. It was wonderful to experience some form of togetherness in this time of separation.</p>\n<p>Please know that my thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of you while we are apart.</p>\n<p>May God continue to protect you and your families,</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"April 17 Update from the President","tags":null,"link":"https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/studentlife/health/center/Coronavirus/apr-17-update-summer-2020.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7c9ee2b2-47c8-51e8-9cd8-56da82bfe035"}}}
