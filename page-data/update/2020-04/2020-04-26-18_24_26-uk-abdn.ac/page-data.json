We appreciate that this is an anxious time for all students and recognise the difficulties that some students may have in completing further assessment at this time.</p>\n<p>Level 1 and 2 Students</p>\n<p>Most Level 1 and Level 2 students will not be required to complete any further assessment (examination or any other outstanding assessment). Students at Levels 1 and 2 will be awarded credit without the need to take any further assessment or examination unless, prior to 28 February 2020, they were notified by email from Registry that they had lost their class certificate for a course (i.e. had received a C7).</p>\n<p>There are a small number of exceptions for Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body requirements (eg Law, Education, Biological Sciences, Accountancy, Education Medicine and Dentistry). Schools will be in touch with those students concerned directly.</p>\n<p>Level 3, 4 and 5 Students</p>\n<p>The University recognises that this is an anxious time and that some students may have difficulties, for a variety of reasons, in completing assessments at this time. It is important, however, that Honours and Postgraduate Taught assessment goes ahead.</p>\n<p>The University has developed no detriment procedures to encourage and support students to continue with their studies and to progress, or complete, as planned but where this is not possible due to the current circumstances caused by COVID-19, to provide students with a safety net.</p>\n<p>The No Detriment procedures provide information on the assessment of levels 3, 4 and 5 for undergraduate and postgraduate taught students. Many of the procedures will already be familiar to students, however, there is some further flexibility within those procedures as the University aims to achieve an appropriate balance between supporting its students while maintaining the fairness and the integrity of a University of Aberdeen award.</p>\n<p>The information provided for students at all levels is supported by a set of Frequently Asked Questions.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions, please contact coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"The University of Aberdeen","tags":null,"link":"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/coronavirus/assessment-10527.php"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6d5b675f-c476-5da2-8a07-fb5db70f7756"}}}
