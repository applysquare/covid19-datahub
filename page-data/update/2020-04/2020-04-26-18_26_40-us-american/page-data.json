When might the university know if classes are going to stay on-campus or be moved online?</p>\n<p>We are preparing for a return to campus for classes and activities in the fall. The schools and colleges are developing classes and curricula; our enrollment teams are working hard to engage our new undergraduate and graduate students; and staff across the university are pushing forward on our strategic priorities. Final operational decisions will be guided by the latest information from health authorities and local governments to ensure the safety of our community. We are closely monitoring the current situation and longer-term projections. We will provide further information for the fall as soon as it is feasible.</p>\n<p>I am still planning to come to DC to complete my degree. Can I begin my first semester courses online if no on-campus courses are being offered in the fall?</p>\n<p>In the event that students cannot return to campus in the fall, most of the current fall course offerings would be available online so you could complete your first semester online and make timely progress toward your degree. We will continue to keep students informed of course offerings.</p>\n<p>Can I begin the first semester of my program online even if AU is offering courses on-campus in the fall?</p>\n<p>Taking courses online in the fall may or may not make sense for your degree if courses are already being offered on-campus. While we do offer online courses every semester, we would recommend that once you are enrolled, you should work with your academic adviser to figure out which courses could be used to fulfill your degree requirements.</p>\n<p>In the event courses are online in the fall, will the quality of the courses suffer?</p>\n<p>AU has a lot of experience in online teaching with many programs delivering engaging online courses. While the academic learning environment may be different, the quality of classroom discussion, engagement, and work will continue to be rigorous.</p>\n<p>If AU's fall classes go online, can I defer my admission to the spring semester/to whenever classes are back in-person?</p>\n<p>As of right now, we are not accepting deferral requests from fall admitted students wishing to defer if AU moves its classes to online for the fall 2020 semester. Students wishing to defer their admission, must provide reasoning that falls within the guidelines of our deferral policy.</p>\n<p>Could I start out part-time?</p>\n<p>Yes. Students for a wide range of reasons, separate from COVID-19, start out part-time. While part-time enrollment is a readily available option, going part-time may have ramifications for your financial aid/student loan/merit scholarships. Before making a final decision, we would urge you to speak to a member of the admissions team to discuss your options and understand any financial aid implications.</p>\n<p>Could I start a course or two this summer rather than wait until the fall?</p>\n<p>This option is a possibility for some graduate programs. We suggest you reach out to your admissions contact to discuss your options.</p>\n<p>I am about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree from AU, could I still consider a bachelors/master’s program?</p>\n<p>In rare cases, undergraduate students graduating in May 2020 may still be able to share credits as part of AU’s bachelors/master’s programs. However, there is an option to do a consecutive graduate program where you would be highly considered for a scholarship equivalent to the cost savings of the credit share.</p>\n<p>I am about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in May. Could I begin a master’s program this fall?</p>\n<p>Yes. We know that due to COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the job market, many graduating students are contemplating their post-graduation plans. If you feel a graduate program might be a better option for you at this time, we would be happy to discuss our programs with you. For more information visit The Office of Graduate Studies.</p>\n<p>Will admissions be extending the May 1 deposit deadline?</p>\n<p>As of right now, AU has not made the decision to extend the May 1 deadline. Should a decision be made to extend the deadline, all admitted students will be notified via email of that change and the new date. For now, the May 1 deposit deadline remains in place.</p>\n<p>What will tuition be if courses are online in fall? Will you be offering discounts? How does this impact financial aid packages?</p>\n<p>We are preparing for a return to campus for classes and activities in the fall. Fall registration and charges will proceed as normally scheduled. We continue to monitor the situation and will make operational decisions based on the latest information from health authorities and local governments to ensure the health and safety of our community. We will provide further information for the fall as soon as it is feasible.</p>\n<p>Will new student orientation be in-person or online?</p>\n<p>To help our new students and families prepare for their AU experience in the fall, while at the same time addressing the challenges of COVID-19, this year’s new student orientation will be comprised of a 10-12 week interactive and engaging virtual experience beginning in mid-May and continuing through early August. Our virtual orientation offers access to university resources and departments, connects new students with orientation leaders, and creates opportunities to meet virtually with fellow new Eagles throughout the summer. Orientation fees are being waived and registration is now open. If you have any questions, please visit the orientation website or email orientation@american.edu.</p>\n<p>If classes go online for the fall semester, how does this impact financial aid packages?</p>\n<p>Financial aid packages for AU students will not change due to the modality of course delivery.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2020","title":"Info for Admitted and Prospective Students","tags":null,"link":"https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/new-students.cfm"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9509c7fe-d8d3-59a7-97a4-2edba42b7155"}}}
