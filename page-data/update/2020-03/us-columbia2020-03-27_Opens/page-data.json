This is in addition to 212 units in Bard Hall at Columbia University Irving Medical Center campus in northern Manhattan. The hospital is distributing keys. Occupancy at Watt began this morning, March 27, at 8 a.m., followed by Bard at 3 p.m., and will start at Woodbridge on Sunday, March 29 at 8 p.m.</p>\n<p>Columbia Public Safety will control around-the-clock access to the buildings. Regular custodial and maintenance services will be provided in the common areas—corridors, stairwells, elevators—garbage and recycling removal will occur at central collection areas, and rooms will be cleaned when occupants turn over.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://transportation.columbia.edu/content/intercampus-shuttle\">Columbia University shuttle bus</a> service is available to ferry staff to and from Watt and Woodbridge in Morningside Heights and the hospital in Washington Heights. Three shuttles will operate on a regular academic year schedule from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m., seven days a week, including holidays.</p>\n<p>“We are honored to support our healthcare professionals in any way we can as they lead us through this extraordinary time,” said Scott Wright, Vice President of Campus Services at Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Added Diana Mejia, Assistant Vice President of Campus Operations and Housing Services at the medical center, “Bard Hall is a very symbolic part of the medical school journey here at CUIMC. It seems especially fitting that we are able to use this residence hall to support our courageous colleagues on the frontlines at NewYork-Presbyterian.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 27, 2020","title":"Columbia Opens Residence Halls to Doctors and Healthcare Workers","tags":null,"link":"https://covid19.columbia.edu/news/columbia-opens-residence-halls-doctors-and-healthcare-workers"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5974c69f-4394-5ea6-8f14-db87e87318ac"}}}
