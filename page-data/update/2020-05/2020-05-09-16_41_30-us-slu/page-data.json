More than 1,600 students have submitted applications thus far, but we believe there could be many others who haven’t applied but could benefit from these relief funds.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage all students who have faced financial challenges due to the pandemic to fill out the application. Even if you are not eligible for a grant through the CARES Act funding, we might be able to connect you with grant awards through our student emergency fund, or other forms of institutional aid.</p>\n<p>There are two ways we are distributing grants using the $2.57 million in CARES Act funding. The first was an automatic $300-$500 grant to students with an Estimated Family Contribution below $12,000 from the 2019-20 FAFSA. Those electronic refunds are processing right now to eligible students and paper checks will be mailed out today to those who didn’t have a refund account on file.</p>\n<p>The second grant option is based on financial needs identified through the application to address expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. We are working hard to process these applications in real time. This grant option could help cover a range of expenses, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<p>Food</p>\n<p>Housing and moving expenses (e.g. rent, storage)</p>\n<p>Technology (e.g. internet, routers, computers, cameras, software)</p>\n<p>Transportation (e.g. unexpected travel costs)</p>\n<p>Child care</p>\n<p>Medical expenses</p>\n<p>Increased utility costs</p>\n<p>Roughly 70 percent of COVID-19 Relief Request applicants indicated that either they or their parents have lost their job. That is a devastating statistic, and one that reminds us how critical it is that we make funding decisions quickly and with care.</p>\n<p>Know that we are here for you. We are OneSLU.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>David Heimburger</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 09, 2020","title":"Reminder: Aid Opportunities for Students in Need","tags":null,"link":"http://www.slu.edu/health-advisory/messages/cares-act-funding-reminder.php"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eb973190-375f-53f7-8ab4-3fafe4102407"}}}
