However, domestic travel plans July 1 and beyond may need to be canceled either due to additional public health or campus travel guidance or financial exigency. At this time, we advise not making reservations for international travel until after June 30.</p>\n<p>In limited cases, academic deans or vice chancellors may approve travel during this travel ban.
