However, the pandemic has disrupted test administrations, and uncertainty remains when and how testing will resume. Earlier this month, Baylor began researching the possibility of a test-optional admissions policy for 2021, receiving feedback from across the University to make its decision.</p>\n<p>“In many respects, this shift to test-optional for 2021 will provide us with an opportunity to develop new strategies that will help us not only for 2021, but for 2022 and beyond as well,” said Jennifer Carron, associate vice president of enrollment management.</p>\n<p>With travel and activity restrictions changing the plans of many rising high school seniors, Baylor also launched its 2020 Summer of Discovery, a collection of discounted summer course bundles for these high school students, as well as current Baylor students and incoming freshmen. The courses provide an opportunity for rising high school seniors to take online Baylor courses at discounted rates for college credit and potential early admission to the University.</p>\n<p>A decision about the role of SAT and ACT scores for the 2022 class will be made next spring. In the meantime, the admissions and enrollment management team will begin working with academic units on adapting the 2021 test-optional policy for scholarships, major-specific entrance requirements, prerequisites and other areas.</p>\n<p>ABOUT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY</p>\n<p>Baylor University is a private Christian University and a nationally ranked research institution.
