However, in addition to the usual grounds for ECs students may claim on the grounds of employment and/or caring responsibilities (there are usually limitations on those grounds), and on a lack of appropriate equipment or technology to complete assessments. Household circumstances (such as a lack of private space in which to undertake an alternative assessment) will also constitute an EC for assessment.</p>\n<p>Additionally, students may self-certify for assessments during the current situation, i.e. a student does not need to supply any supporting evidence for an EC claim to be accepted (but must still submit the claim itself, in the usual manner).
