As the timeline to lift restrictions is unclear, UQ has made a number of decisions in relation to Semester Two to enable you to plan for your academic studies for the remainder of this year.</p>\n<p>The impacts of COVID-19 has meant that we have had to delay the commencement of <strong>Semester Two 2020</strong> with scheduled classes starting one week later on <strong>3 August and finishing on 30 October 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The 2020 Academic Calendar can be found <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&#x26;2=25191\">here</a>. The following is a summary of the Semester Two 2020 adjustments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orientation for students will be online Wednesday 29 July - Saturday 1 August with some activities on campuses subject to Government restrictions.</li>\n<li>Teaching will be delivered online for Semester Two, regardless of your location, to mitigate against restrictions being relaxed and then tightened again as we have seen in other countries. We are working on reintroducing on-campus and extra-curricular activities to enhance your learning experience, in the anticipation that society will return to a degree of normality in the not too distant future. We will communicate further detail about this as soon as possible.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&#x26;2=25192\">Census Date</a> and <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&#x26;2=25193\">Withdrawal without Financial Penalty</a> for Semester Two will be 31 August 2020.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&#x26;2=25194\">Withdrawal without Academic Penalty</a> for Semester Two will be 30 October 2020.</li>\n<li>You can view the Semester Two course offerings <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNQ~wozDv8S~xb~Gv9k~yKvMuspXy77Mv~x~z7~Pv84&#x26;2=25195\">online</a> from Monday 11 May.
