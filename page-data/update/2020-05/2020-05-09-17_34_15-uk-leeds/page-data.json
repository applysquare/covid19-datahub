This will initially give you access to M and N Drives and any websites that are normally only available on campus (e.g. Library resources). The service is being developed rapidly, and more applications will be added over the next few weeks. If you have a staff account, you will already have access to this; if you have a student account you will have access soon. This will eventually be a replacement for Desktop Anywhere. Find out how to get started on the IT website </p>\n<p>May Bank Holiday The University will be closed (which at the moment means we’re all still at home, but not working!) on the 8 May for the May Day/VE Day bank holiday.
