Students should remain where they are currently living and follow social distancing rules - see <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students\">advice for current students</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Staff carrying out <strong>business critical work</strong> that requires them to be on campus - where there is a significant consequence to health, safety and welfare if the work cannot continue - should have been notified and must carry a valid photo ID/UCard with them at all times.</li>\n<li>Stay at home for seven days if you have a high temperature and/or a new continuous cough.
