If you experience exceptional circumstances, you can make a claim up to seven days after the exam, even if you have submitted your exam.</p>\n<p>This is in recognition of the variety of impacts that you may be feeling in the current circumstances, and of the fact that these impacts are sometimes only recognised in retrospect.</p>\n<p>If you are a postgraduate student or International Pathway College student whose online exams have already been submitted earlier in the term, and where exceptional circumstances impacted your performance, we will allow a retrospective ECA claim now if you have not already submitted one. This claim may be submitted at any point in the next seven days. The Exceptional Circumstances web pages and Covid-19 FAQs are in the process of being updated</p>\n<p>If you are an undergraduate student, we are not yet in a position to release your formally calculated 'safety net' marks, but would like to remind you that the \"estimator\" remains available to all students, and if you enter your assessment data correctly, it is a very good indicator of what your safety net mark should be.</p>\n<p>We'd like to wish you all the best in your exams, and ask that you stay in touch with your department if you have any questions or concerns about your studies or your assessments.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>The University Academic Contingency Group</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 16, 2020","title":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk/update-messages-and-emails/tuesday-12-may-student-email"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0af8893e-2831-5941-897a-f99a618c1026"}}}
