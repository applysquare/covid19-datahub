This decision was based on the health and safety concerns associated with global and domestic travel.</p>\n<p>Advisors in the Center for Education Abroad (CEA) are available to support all students who were planning on an international experience this fall. Due to the uncertainty of the current global landscape, the University will not be allowing any waivers or exceptions for fall 2020 education abroad programs, including programs with delayed start dates in September.</p>\n<p>To contact an Education Abroad advisor with any questions or to discuss options for a future education abroad program during another term, students can email ceaadvisors@rochester.edu. Virtual appointments can be scheduled with an advisor here. If students have not done so already, they should register for fall 2020 courses via UR Student as soon as possible. Additional information on how to register for fall 2020 courses can be found here.</p>\n<p>Students who did not complete the housing lottery should contact Residential Life directly at housingassignments@reslife.rochester.edu to submit an application for the waiting list or explore off-campus options.</p>\n<p>CEA will be offering a condensed portfolio of virtual programs to include both academic and internship opportunities for summer and fall terms, however a summer or fall virtual program will not take the place of a full-term abroad academic program. The Education Abroad office will share more details about these opportunities and how to register in a future communication.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 12, 2020","title":"Education Abroad programs canceled for fall 2020","tags":null,"link":"https://www.rochester.edu/coronavirus-update/education-abroad-programs-canceled-for-fall-2020/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4d7f9661-6e38-5555-b0e5-d4cc5e635c56"}}}
