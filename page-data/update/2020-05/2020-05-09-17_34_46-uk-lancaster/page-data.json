Where we have to, we will be setting some coursework or short tests as appropriate to your course. These will be designed to cover the same material as the assessment that you were expecting. <strong>Your progression status will be based on the marks that you have accumulated to date (including any outstanding coursework) and any additional assessment that is required.</strong> In calculating the progression status we may make adjustments to reflect relative performances between exams and coursework. We are aiming to give you the best possible opportunity to be successful.</p>\n<p>Where you have a failed module/modules you will be required to attempt the assessment for these modules in August using an online exam. Performance in these assessments will be treated as the assessments in Summer Term (Term 3) 2020. If you fail your first attempt in August you will be advised about options. We are aiming to give you the best possible opportunity to be successful.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 08, 2020","title":"Undergraduates-Non-final year Part II students","tags":null,"link":"https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/cms/coronavirus/exams-teaching-and-assessment"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"278f5c05-8e7a-528f-b88e-34394dfe3175"}}}
