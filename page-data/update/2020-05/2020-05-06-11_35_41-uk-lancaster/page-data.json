Exceptions will be necessary in some cases (e.g. where still required by professional or regulatory bodies in particular disciplines) and your department will communicate with you shortly with details about any exceptions. In the majority of cases the marks recorded for Part I will be based on the marks that you have accumulated to date and any remaining coursework. In calculating the marks we may make adjustments to reflect relative performances between exams and coursework. We are aiming to give you the best possible opportunity to be successful.</p>\n<p>We will put in place specific support in Part II for students whose mark profile suggests this may be required (including Academic Probation). For students on programmes that require specific levels of attainment in Part I (e.g. placements) that cannot be evidenced without exams, opportunities will be provided for online assessments during summer 2020.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 30, 2020","title":"Undergraduates-Part I students","tags":null,"link":"https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/cms/coronavirus/exams-teaching-and-assessment"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f4830995-734b-5de1-9ceb-6e747f98597c"}}}
