This will initially give you access to M and N Drives and any websites that are normally only available on campus (eg Library resources). The service is being developed rapidly, and more applications will be added over the next few weeks.  If you have a staff account, you will already have access to this; if you have a student account you will have access in the next few days. This will eventually be a replacement for Desktop Anywhere. Find out how to get started on the IT website </p>\n<p>Please keep in touch with your supervisor/s and continue to maintain your GRAD record.  We are asking PGRs whose work is affected by the current circumstances in any way (e.g. lack of access to facilities, inability to carry out fieldwork, caring duties, etc.) to document this in a ‘supervision meeting’ record on GRAD so that your supervisors are aware and so that we can take this into account should we need to in future.

The 2020 recipients are Oliver Grasham from the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Bioenergy and Harriet Thew from the School of Earth and Environment.  Both prize winners will deliver presentations at the virtual award event( <a href=\"https://climate.leeds.ac.uk/events/piers-sellers-prize-2020/\">https://climate.leeds.ac.uk/events/piers-sellers-prize-2020/</a> ) on Wednesday 10 June.</p>\n<p>Oliver Grasham researches novel ways to integrate carbon intensive waste processes with the production of sustainable energy and biofuels.  He was nominated for the Piers Sellers PhD prize by his supervisor Dr Valerie Dupont, from the School of Chemical and Process Engineering, after conducting his research as part of the Bioenergy Centre for Doctoral Training.</p>\n<p>Harriet Thew is part of the Sustainability Research Institute. Her research is focused on youth participation in and around the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nShe was nominated for the Piers Sellers PhD prize by her supervisors Dr Lucie Middlemiss and Professor Jouni Paavola, who are both from the School of Earth and Environment.

Nazia said:<br>\n“I entered my first ever Hackathon (at Hackmed) last March at University of Sheffield and won first prize. So this year I returned to the Hackathon called Hackmed, which is a medical themed Hackathon and we created an app which rapidly analyses genomic data. I’m a first year bioinformatics and genomics student at the Faculty of Medicine and Health, funded by the MRC. We focused on the covid theme, using the latest genomic data which was released by the team at Sheffield. We went in as a team of two first year female bioinformatics students, we didn’t think we could do it but we won first prize! </p>\n<p>I just want to say that, it can be quite scary to enter these Hackathon competitions as they are so competitive and full of brilliant people from all disciplines around the country. But I am so glad that we did enter, because it forces you to think outside the box and work under pressure to create something novel within the space of a weekend! It’s inspired me to start my own Hackathon society at the University of Leeds! I’ve already got the ball rolling by sending off a form to the student’s union, fingers crossed! And hopefully next year Leeds will be holding its own medical themed Hackathon!”  More about the Hackathon themes( <a href=\"http://hackmed.uk/\">http://hackmed.uk/</a> ) and details of the winning work( <a href=\"https://www.dimen.org.uk/news/hackmed-win\">https://www.dimen.org.uk/news/hackmed-win</a> ).</p>\n<p>LinkedIn Learning  Competition Winner   Congratulations to Harrison Johnson-Evans who has won £100 love2shop voucher for winning the LinkedIn Learning competition.  Harrison managed to complete an impressive number of videos to win the competition. Harrison commented \"My project is heavily lab-based so when working from home started, I decided to spend a couple of hours every day learning new skills on LinkedIn learning.  I’ve learned a few new tricks with excel, word and PowerPoint, while also teaching myself to use MatLab and Python\".\nLinkedIn Learning has become a popular resource over the recent weeks and usage has increased significantly.

So in lieu of regular Research Nights taking place in Pyramid in LUU, we would like to invite you to join us for the monthly #ResearchNightsIn coming soon to Twitter, showcasing some of the fascinating research being conducted by you!\nIf you would like to take part by creating a short video to explain your research or a fun fact from your area, just email doctoralcollege@leeds.ac.uk  to express your interest. It’s a great opportunity to test the waters and develop skills in online engagement.</p>\n<p>British Science Association Community Buddy scheme The BSA are looking for researchers to help us extend our community engagement programme by buddying up with community organisers in their local area, could you help? For the last five years, the Association has been building a solid community engagement programme( <a href=\"https://www.britishscienceassociation.org/community-engagement\">https://www.britishscienceassociation.org/community-engagement</a> ) through a series of grants, workshops and leadership schemes. This includes supporting community organisers to develop and design science engagement that is relevant and responsive to their community’s needs; those communities range from new arrivals to the UK and children with disabilities to people living in rural areas and adults accessing drug recovery services.  From speaking to community organisers, they rarely have access to researchers. The appetite to work collaboratively is there, and people are looking for science role models that live locally that they can build into their engagement activities.
