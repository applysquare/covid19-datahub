Shepherd, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>I'm pleased to share with you information regarding Caltech's June 12 virtual commencement event. This event, as announced in the <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/updates/sp/4162020\">April 16 community message from President Thomas F. Rosenbaum and Provost David A. Tirrell</a>, is the first part of our two-part celebration of Caltech's 2020 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral candidates. It is our hope that this virtual event will serve as a meaningful and personal way of recognizing your significant accomplishments and will allow us to confer your degrees in a timely manner. To take full advantage of the digital environment, we are working closely with student representatives to customize the experience for our community.  </p>\n<p><strong>About the Virtual Event:</strong><br>\nThe virtual commencement will air on June 12, 2020, at 10 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on commencement.caltech.edu/watch. The ceremony will include remarks from President Rosenbaum and Board Chair David Lee, special remarks from notable Caltech alumni and friends of Caltech, and the conferral of undergraduate and graduate degrees. During the degree conferral, individual student names will be read by your deans and division chairs, just as they would at a typical in-person commencement event. In addition, the virtual nature of this event provides us the opportunity to create a personalized slide for each graduate to accompany the reading of names.  </p>\n<p><strong>Ways to Connect Virtually:</strong><br>\nIn addition to the virtual event video airing at 10 a.m. on June 12, you and your friends and families will have opportunities to celebrate together across distances and from the comfort of your residences through student-hosted watch parties, virtual class photos, and a memory wall on <a href=\"http://commencement.caltech.edu/\">the commencement website</a> that will feature submitted photos, videos, and messages from the Caltech community. More information on these ways to connect will be shared in a subsequent email.  </p>\n<p><strong>Regalia and Commemorative Items:</strong><br>\nPrior to the June 12 event, each of you will receive in the mail a printed commencement invitation. After commencement, you will receive a diploma and diploma cover as a gift from Caltech.  </p>\n<p>We invite you to order regalia online and have it shipped to your home in advance of the June 12 event, so that you can pose for cap and gown photos and may consider including such a photo on your personalized grad slide or sharing it on social media the day of the event. Please know that the Institute is covering the cost of regalia for every student graduating in June.  </p>\n<p>In order to make this special event a reality, however, we need your help.
