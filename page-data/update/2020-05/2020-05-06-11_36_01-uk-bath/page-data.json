If you have joined the University from February 2020 you can now access this session online.  </li>\n<li><strong>Approval of candidature</strong><br>\nIt is possible that the current crisis may lead you to delay your start date but if you do start your doctorate during this crisis, you will still need to complete your Candidature form with your supervisor within one month of your start date if you are full-time, or within three months if you are part-time. Candidature forms will continue to be submitted to FDSCs for approval in the normal way.  </li>\n<li><strong>Confirmation (not required for Professional Doctorates)</strong><br>\nStudents who are unable to submit for confirmation by their expected deadline because of the COVID-19 crisis, should <a href=\"mailto:doctoralcollege@bath.ac.uk\">email the Doctoral College</a> to request an extension to their deadline.<br>\nGiven that face-to-face confirmations are no longer possible, and if it is not possible to delay the confirmation, students and supervisors may need to request to hold the session via video conferencing.
