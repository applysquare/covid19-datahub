A few weeks ago, we shared with you (new window) the difficult decision that we will be unable to gather in person this May for our Ceremonies of Commencement and would be postponing our 2020 Commencement.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, in consultation with students and colleagues around the University, we have determined the importance of also coming together virtually to celebrate the Class of 2020.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, May 16 at 1:00 PM (eastern daylight time), our University community is invited to convene together virtually to recognize the Class of 2020. While we will gather in celebration in-person at a future moment, this ceremony will mark an important milestone, as our students transition from students to alumni. As part of this ceremony, degrees will be awarded to our undergraduate, graduate, and professional students of Georgetown College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law Center, School of Nursing and Health Studies, Walsh School of Foreign Service and GU-Qatar, McDonough School of Business, School of Continuing Studies, and McCourt School of Public Policy.</p>\n<p>Our School of Medicine will host a Commencement Ceremony, virtually, on Sunday, May 17 at 11:00 AM. The leadership of our Medical Center and School of Medicine, in consultation with students, faculty, and staff, determined that it was most appropriate to hold a virtual Commencement for our School of Medicine graduates, given the nature of their roles and responsibilities over the coming year.</p>\n<p>Students will receive additional information in the coming days from their respective dean. They will also receive information about the distribution of diplomas from their Registrar.</p>\n<p>Details about these events (as well as some additional gatherings) will also be shared on our Commencement website (new window) in the coming days. On May 11, we will launch a new website with videos, messages, and stories celebrating our students. I hope that you will join us as we recognize the Class of 2020.</p>\n<p>I wish to express my gratitude to our entire community for the ways that you have approached these last few weeks, with care and compassion for one another, and for the creativity and flexibility that you have brought to our academic community. We are especially grateful to our graduating class, for your resilience in completing your course of study. I wish you all the very best in these final days of the semester.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>John J.
