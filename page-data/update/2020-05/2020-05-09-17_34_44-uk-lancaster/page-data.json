We believe that these marks, obtained during the period before Covid-19, provide the most accurate indication of a student’s performance. We hope that removing exams will also help to alleviate anxiety amongst students.</p>\n<p>Secondly, for all assessments undertaken since the suspension of classroom teaching, Exam Boards will have additional checks in place to ensure that any adverse effects are taken into account when considering students' results. You do not need to submit an ‘exceptional circumstances’ claim as all Exam Boards will be taking the situation into account in determining your results.
