Move from a standard letter grade mode (A-F) to COVID-19 P/F mode in a course. Move from a COVID-19 P/F grade mode back to a standard letter grade mode (A-F) (as long as the course is not normally offered as pass/fail only).</p>\n<p>Your current grade mode elections for College courses only (as of 4-27 at 8:30 AM EDT) are as follows:</p>\n<p>[Student courses and selections listed here.]</p>\n<p>On Friday, (before this decision by the Deans) you were provided access to a separate Form with a use-by deadline of Monday. If you have used that form to elect a COVID-19 P/F in one or more of your classes, those elections will be honored.</p>\n<p>However, if you wish to change any additional courses to COVID-19 P/F or return to a standard letter grade mode (A-F) from a COVID-19 P/F grade mode, please use this new Form. You do not need to repeat any elections you have previously made on another Form.</p>\n<p>I know this is confusing, but the decisions concerning this COVID-19 P/F Option have been fluid these last few days, as the Deans listened to your comments/concerns and acted to help you.</p>\n<p>This is your final opportunity to change a grade mode for the Spring 2020 semester with the deadline for these elections being Thursday (04/30) by 11:59 PM EDT. After this deadline, we will notify each of your instructors with your elections.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Harold L Pace</p>\n<p>University Registrar</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 30, 2020","title":"Final Opportunity to Change Grade Mode for Spring 2020 College Courses","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.wfu.edu/university-communications/final-opportunity-to-change-grade-mode-for-spring-2020-college-courses/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"56d1a08c-37de-5dff-904b-0d9bacae2091"}}}
