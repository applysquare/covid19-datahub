These courses are being updated on DukeHub and will be open for registration on Friday, May 1 at 9:00 am EDT. Most of the courses will be listed by 9 am on Friday but others will be added over the next couple of days and we encourage you to keep checking DukeHub for updates until May 3rd.</p>\n<p>All Summer Session II courses will be delivered remotely. If you were previously registered in a Duke Summer Session II course which is now being offered online, you will automatically be moved into the new course. We will not automatically cancel your registration in these courses in order to maintain your enrollment in the class; however, we ask that you unregister through DukeHub if you no longer plan to take the online course so the spot can be made available to others. We have also maintained the wait list for all Summer Session II courses in order to preserve your position to get into a course.</p>\n<p>For more information about the course, fees and schedules, visit:<a href=\"https://summersession.duke.edu/duke-students/frequently-asked-questions-summer-session\">https://summersession.duke.edu/duke-students/frequently-asked-questions-summer-session</a> or contact Kim Price at kprice@duke.edu.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and for your strong interest in this wide array of courses available for the Duke Summer Session.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jennifer Francis</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Provost</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 30, 2020","title":"New Courses for Duke Summer Session II","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.duke.edu/2020/04/new-courses-for-duke-summer-session-ii/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"14664ae7-fbef-524a-8271-b100c41323ce"}}}
