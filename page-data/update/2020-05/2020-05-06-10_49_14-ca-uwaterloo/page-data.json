I have not used any unauthorized aids. I have not and will not discuss the contents of this test until after the submission deadline I acknowledge that the typical penalty specified in Policy 71 for a first offence of premeditated cheating is zero on the test, course failure, suspension and disciplinary probation</p>\n<p>Instructors (and their TAs) are asked to bring forward suspicions of cheating during tests to me, Barb Moffatt or Sam St. Amand</p>\n<p>Warn students that a number of companies falsely present themselves as tutoring services when they are actually cheating services. For example, the Toronto-based Easy Group Inc has recently been implicated in a cheating scandal at the University of Alberta. UWaterloo’s IST has now blocked Easy Group Inc’s various email accounts (ez4edu.com, easygroup.ca, ez4edu.shop, ez4edu.info, ezeduonline.com) but there are other comparable companies in existence. Students need to understand that they place themselves in jeopardy of Policy 71 allegations when using online sources and that their use often leaves an identifiable trail. The Office of Academic Integrity provides helpful resources to students, faculty and staff regarding how to maintain academic integrity.</p>\n<p>I hope this information assists you.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 23, 2020","title":"Science update: Strategies for completing winter 2020 courses amidst COVID-19: Addendum 8 | Coronavirus Information","tags":null,"link":"https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/news/science-update-strategies-completing-winter-2020-courses-7"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"10a9da4b-6607-5bf1-95c1-68054f6dd110"}}}
