This means there are no face-to-face lectures, seminars, tutorials, practicals or field courses for the rest of the academic year including the summer period.</p>\n<p>We are making arrangements for essential services to be maintained and are transitioning to online teaching. This means that students will be able to continue their studies online if they are well enough to do so.</p>\n<p>If you feel unwell and have questions around how to self-isolate, please read the <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs\">main FAQs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need to self-isolate you should inform your academic department in the first instance, they will be sympathetic to your situation and support you in using the <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/forms/circs\">extenuating circumstances</a> process if required.</p>\n<p>You should also notify your landlord or residential provider, as well as notifying students support services by <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJQi2EtLsE3TmWew-M1R2djxspy8SBkTvLqARoWneH2C5iWQ/viewform\">filling in this form</a>.

You may also find it helpful to talk to the Student Advice Centre for guidance on any related matters personal to your circumstances.</p>\n<p>It is important to stress however that your health and wellbeing and those of your fellow students is the first priority. As such, self-isolation for those too unwell to engage in online learning as stated by Public Health England is vital and doing so will not harm you academically, nor will it impact any Tier 4 visa restrictions for international students. UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) has indicated that it will work to ensure students are not disadvantaged by the situation.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 30, 2020","title":"I'm worried about self-isolating and the consequences on my learning.
