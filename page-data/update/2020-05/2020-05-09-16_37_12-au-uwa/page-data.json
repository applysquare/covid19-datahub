The University’s exam rules have been adapted for online exams. Please familiarise yourself with the rules in advance of sitting your exam: Check the list of items that you are allowed to bring into the examination. This information will be available from Friday, 22 May 2020. Access this information via your personal timetable. If your exam requires a calculator you may only use one approved for the exam you’re sitting. View the approved calculator list.</p>\n<p>If you are sitting an Online Examplify (ExamSoft) exam you will need to complete the UWA Examplify Mock Exam. The Mock Exam is a compulsory step for Examplify exams and you will not be able to sit your exam(s) without having completed it first. The UWA Examplify Mock Exam helps you familiarise yourself with the system, check technical requirements and establishes your ID in preparation for your exams. You do not need your Student ID for this, the system captures your image for ID verification during the exam. The UWA Examplify Mock Exam takes 10 minutes, it is a generic exam for all students and is not marked. The Mock Exam is scheduled to be held from 12 May to 14 May 2020 and you will be sent an email in advance on the process involved. Support materials are being prepared to help you with the UWA Examplify Mock Exam. If you remain concerned about sitting an exam on Examplify due to privacy concerns please read the information on how we are supporting your privacy. If you still have concerns you can contact us via askUWA or you may opt-out by 19 May and sit the exam at a later date when face-to-face options are available (please note due to Government COVID-19 restrictions we cannot yet commit to a timeframe) or an alternate assessment if you are due to graduate midyear.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 05, 2020","title":"Semester 1, 2020 exam timetable released","tags":null,"link":"http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/2020050512054/december-2018/semester-1-2020-exam-timetable-released"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"81f955d0-4805-5287-8ea7-fcf91cf67037"}}}
