While a few events may be held as planned—in compliance with state and local orders for gathering sizes—we know that anything considered large or even medium-scale will not take place. This message focuses specifically on decisions about summer events, conferences and camps. A message providing more details about our summer quarter academic programs will be shared with you soon, as will our decision about Summer Commencement, typically held in August.</p>\n<p>Below is a brief summary of the decisions that have been reached so far. This information will allow people to make alternate plans, while also helping to keep our community safe.</p>\n<p>Admission events— Campus visits will depend on current travel restrictions, gathering sizes, and room availability on campus. We hope to have more guidance on admissions tours very soon.</p>\n<p>Campus visits will depend on current travel restrictions, gathering sizes, and room availability on campus.

We’ll also continue to keep our COVID-19 website up to date with critical health-and-safety information and return-to-work protocols.</p>\n<p>You’ll also find more information about how Colorado’s Safer-at-Home Order applies to higher education here.</p>\n<p>We so look forward to the day when we can celebrate together, greet prospective students and their families, engage in conferences with colleagues from across the country and the world, and watch our youngest visitors enjoy our robust camp offerings. In the meantime, stay safe, be well and do good.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jeremy Haefner</p>\n<p>Chancellor</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 14, 2020","title":"Summer Programs & Events at DU","tags":null,"link":"https://www.du.edu/news/summer-programs-events-du"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"61900c17-0683-50cd-a41a-b10afe9e0457"}}}
