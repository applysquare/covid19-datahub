Although we share in many of the challenges this pandemic has brought all of our lives, everyone's circumstances are unique in their own way.</p>\n<p>There are several steps you can take to help you maintain your focus and attention and support your mental health and well-being, even when your regular routine may feel out of sync:</p>\n<p>Focus on getting enough sleep.

Planning your day and making sure to take breaks throughout will help you to sustain your energy and focus, one task and exam at a time!</p>\n<p>Stay healthy and remember social distancing, hand washing and face covering when out in public. We wish you the best!
