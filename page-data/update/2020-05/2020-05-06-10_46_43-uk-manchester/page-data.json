It is open all year round and can award small grants and loans to help students overcome financial hardship – and we understand that at the moment there may be unexpected or additional money worries.</p>\n<p>This is why we’ve updated the information on the Student Support money pages to outline just some of the current issues we can help with (although this isn’t exclusive, so so get in touch if you’re struggling in other ways), and we’re now accepting scanned supporting documents. We’re also working hard to process all applications as quickly as we can.</p>\n<p>Find out more information and how to apply on the Student Support money pages.</p>\n<p>Share this: Twitter</p>\n<p>Facebook</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 29, 2020","title":"Here to help: Living Cost Support Fund open for applications","tags":null,"link":"https://studentnews.manchester.ac.uk/2020/04/29/here-to-help-living-cost-support-fund-open-for-applications/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"67e46839-42cc-5d3f-b4da-801e8ae3a05c"}}}
