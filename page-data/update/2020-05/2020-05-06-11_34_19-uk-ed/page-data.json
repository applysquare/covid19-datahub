We will be taking the following approach to engagement and attendance monitoring for the remainder of the semester:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergraduate students should engage with the remote teaching provided by their School.  Results of assessments and exams will be recorded on your student record once marked.</li>\n<li>Postgraduate taught student engagement will be recorded through remote contact with your supervisor and dissertation hand in.</li>\n<li>Postgraduate research student engagement will be recorded through contact with your supervisor, remotely if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Provided you engage with your studies remotely, there will be no impact on your Tier 4 Visa.  We do recognise that not it may not be possible for all students to engage with their studies in this way; therefore if you will not be engaging with your studies remotely, you must inform your school and take an Authorised Interruption of Study. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 30, 2020","title":"Tier 4 sponsored students: evidencing engagement and attendance","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/covid-19"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b1b6b40f-236b-5e5f-84e2-1dc2a0b40b74"}}}
