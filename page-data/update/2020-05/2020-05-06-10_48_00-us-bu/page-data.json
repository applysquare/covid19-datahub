While we will continue to add programs in the weeks ahead, at this stage, we know that students in the following programs will be able to take advantage of this opportunity for the fall 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Students that are enrolled in a dual degree program should consult with both schools about fall offerings.</p>\n<p>We are continuing to evaluate all our graduate and professional program offerings so that we may offer the educational experience you expect from Boston University. As we determine that it is possible and appropriate to offer additional programs via live remote class sessions, we will communicate to students via email and update this page accordingly.</p>\n<p>College of Communication Advertising (MS)</p>\n<p>Emerging Media Studies (MA)</p>\n<p>Journalism (MS)</p>\n<p>Media Science (MS)</p>\n<p>Public Relations (MS)</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Bioinformatics (MS)</p>\n<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering (MS)</p>\n<p>Materials Science and Engineering (MEng, MS)</p>\n<p>Mechanical Engineering (MEng, MS)</p>\n<p>Frederick S.
