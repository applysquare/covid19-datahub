We will be reviewing the new order over the next few days to determine whether there will be any additional changes to current operations.</p>\n<p>The City of Berkeley health officer, along with those from six Bay Area Counties, released the details of the new order today. It goes into effect May 4 and will replace the current shelter-in-place order that expires May 3.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the extended shelter in place timeline, the campus will be cancelling campus events that were scheduled to take place May 4 – May 31.</p>\n<p>In issuing the new order, the public health officials noted that it is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activities while also preventing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the counties. The new order allows for certain outdoor activities and businesses including landscaping/gardening businesses, summer camps for limited numbers of children with parents in specific workforces, etc.</p>\n<p>I want to thank you for continuing to do your part to protect our community and to keep yourself safe. Please continue to visit the campus’s COVID-19 website for the latest informatIon and updates.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 29, 2020","title":"Shelter-in-place order extended through May 31","tags":null,"link":"https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/29/shelter-in-place-order-extended-through-may-31/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aa29446c-1cbb-5ef4-9033-911ff97f3c25"}}}
