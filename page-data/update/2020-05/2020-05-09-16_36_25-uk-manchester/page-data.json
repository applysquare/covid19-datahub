But we wanted to remind you that you can still access training and development opportunities.</p>\n<p>The Faculty based researcher development teams are delivering workshops online and making new resources available all the time. Keep in touch with your Faculty for further details – Science and Engineering, Humanities, Biology, Medicine and Health.</p>\n<p>The Careers Service is also here to support all students. They have moved lots of their services online – from online careers appointments to workshops and links to training.</p>\n<p>Some publishers are providing temporary access to e-resources, including e-books, during the period of the COVID-19 outbreak. More information is available on the Library resources website. To support your learning and adjustment to researching remotely you can also access other Library learning and resources, including My Research Essentials and external resources such as LinkedIn Learning.</p>\n<p>And it’s not just about your research, remember to take care of yourself too – working from home, juggling priorities and coping with social isolation are difficult. PGR Life is full of useful resources and advice for managing your wellbeing whilst researching remotely. The University also has lots of resources on the Student Support website. From helping you stay motivated and focussed, to coping with anxiety and looking after your mental health, we’re here to help.</p>\n<p>Share this: Twitter</p>\n<p>Facebook</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2020","title":"PGR Training and Development – still here to support you and your research","tags":null,"link":"https://studentnews.manchester.ac.uk/2020/05/04/pgr-training-and-development-still-here-to-support-you-and-your-research/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"92bd496e-6c2e-527c-9698-a0930fb7a098"}}}
