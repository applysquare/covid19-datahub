Our response will, of course, continue to be guided by the government’s guidelines and restrictions.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, please continue to take care of yourselves and your families and friends by following the Government’s restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19:\n· Stay home\n· Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (and only if you cannot work from\nhome)\n· If you go out, stay two metres (six feet) away from other people\n· Wash your hands as soon as you get home\n· Do not meet others, even friends and family.</p>\n<p>Further information is available from Public Health England( <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england</a> ) and the NHS( <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/\">https://www.nhs.uk/</a> ). If you are outside of the UK, please continue to follow local government guidance.</p>\n<p>No detriment policy</p>\n<p>We’re sorry we were not able to provide students who are sitting assessments this summer with an update on the no detriment policy on Monday 27 April as originally planned.</p>\n<p>We understand that this is a challenging time for many of you and we apologise if this has caused you additional worries.</p>\n<p>Please be assured that we are continuing to work on the proposals for this policy, which will be discussed by the University’s Senate on Tuesday 5 May. We will provide you with a further update following this date.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions please visit the Frequently Asked Questions( <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/coronavirus/faq/\">https://www.dur.ac.uk/coronavirus/faq/</a> ) section of our dedicated Covid-19 webpage.
