This service reduction is currently expected to last until the end of May. In addition, following the closure of Paris-Orly airport, all of our flights to and from Paris now operate to or from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. Connecting flights continue to operate as planned. To help you to adjust your travel plans in light of the ongoing health crisis, **we have put in place exceptional measures throughout our network. ** Before making any travel plans, please contact the relevant national authorities to check entry and stay requirements in your destination and transit countries. We also advise you to make backup plans for both your travel and accommodation. Please be advised that upon arrival in metropolitan France or its overseas departments, you must be able to present a certificate of exceptional travel to the authorities in charge of border control. This also applies if you have a flight connection in France. Visit the website of the French Interior Ministry to download the certificate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestation-de-deplacement-derogatoire-et-justificatif-de-deplacement-professionnel\">Download certificate of exceptional travel</a> </p>\n<h3>YOU ARE ABROAD AND WISH TO RETURN TO FRANCE</h3>\n<p>We are currently offering special fares for French and European citizens and residents who wish to return to France, as well as additional flights. . <strong>If you have a ticket for a flight operated by Air France</strong>, we recommend that you plan your return trip to France as soon as possible, by changing your booking online in the \"My Bookings\" section of our website or in the mobile application.
