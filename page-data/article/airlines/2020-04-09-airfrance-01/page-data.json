This service reduction is currently expected to last until the end of May. In addition, following the closure of Paris-Orly airport on 1 April 2020, all of our flights to and from Paris will now operate from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. Connecting flights will continue to operate as planned. As always, we will keep you informed if there are any changes to your booking. To help you to adjust your travel plans in light of the ongoing health crisis, <strong>we have put in place exceptional measures throughout our network. **Before making any travel plans, please contact the relevant national authorities to check entry and stay requirements in your destination and transit countries. We also advise you to make backup plans for both your travel and accommodation.
